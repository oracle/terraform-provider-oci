## 2.1.17 - 2018-08-02

### Fixed
- Fix bug that was causing creation of tags and tagging namespaces to fail (#562)

## 2.1.16 - 2018-07-19

- Fix bug introduced in v2.1.14 (#558), failure updating a Route Table's Route Rules when they contain a rule that includes a Service Gateway ID

## 2.1.14 - 2018-07-13

###Notes
_This build contains a known issue where updates to a Route Table's Route Rules (when they contain a rule that includes a Service Gateway ID) fail with a 400 service error code (#558). The issue is fixed in v2.1.15._

### Added
- Ability to create and manage email approved senders, suppressions, and SMTP credentials
- Adding Service Gateway resource and data source, update Route Table and Security List
- Add Audit service configuration resource
- Support Identity Federation

### Changed
- Users may notice larger diffs for Security List's `ingress_security_rules`, `egress_security_rules` and Route Table's `route_rules`. The internal representation has been changed from Lists to Sets, which results in unexpected but innocuous Terraform behavior. See this issue for discussion: https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/15180
- Default timeout changed from 5 minutes to 15 minutes to accommodate some resources that may take longer to succeed
- Ability to update compartment of an Object Storage Bucket
- Updated Database data source to support tags

### Fixed
- Delete behavior fixed on Load Balancer resources for failed work requests

## 2.1.13 - 2018-07-02

### Added

- Support health status datasources for load balancer, backends, and backend sets
- Object Storage Buckets supports [storage tier](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/managingbuckets.htm) settings.
- Object Storage Objects can be renamed.
- Object Storage Objects data source supports specifying a `delimiter`.

- Create backups from a database.
- Support creating a DBSystem from a Database backup.
- Support db_system_id for db_versions data source.
- The db_system_shapes data source results now include information about max/min node count, and min core count supported by the relevant shape.
- Assign backup policies to volumes.
- Support additional ways of finding a Public IP via custom Public IP data source.
- Ability to create and manage console connections.

### Changed
- Object Storage Object's attributes other than `name` are now marked `forceNew`. This is consistent with the behavior of the service as defined [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/objectstorage/20160918/Object/PutObject).

### Fixed
- Multiple updates on Object Storage Object's metadata used to cause contents of the file to get overwritten by its md5 value.
- DBSystems cpu_core_count was made optional as the service ignores it when you provide a VM shape. [#517](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/issues/517), [#539](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/issues/539).

## 2.1.2 - 2018-03-26

### Added

- Load Balancer Listeners: Added [connection_configuration](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/blob/master/docs/load_balancer/listeners.md) attribute for specifying idle timeouts. (#425)

## 2.1.1 - 2018-03-14

- Instances: Add missing state field to datasource.

## 2.1.0 - 2018-03-08
More details for the changes introduced in 2.1.0 can be found [here](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/wiki/Details-for-v2.1.0-Release)

### Added
- [Client side filtering](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/blob/master/docs/Filters.md) is now enabled for all data sources that return a list.
- Some Core data sources now support server side filtering by `display_name` and `state`.
- New optional parameters and fields have been added to existing resources and data sources to support new functionality added by the services.
- Documentation files have been updated and improved. Documentation files for resources and data sources of the same entity have now been consolidated into one file.

### Deprecated
- `limit` and `page` parameters in data sources have been deprecated. All list data sources loop through all the pages and return one aggregated list.  
- The `time_modified` field was deprecated from a few resources as it is no longer set by the service.

### Fixed
- Updates to fields in `oci_objectstorage_preauthrequest` resource will force the destruction and recreation of the resource. Updates to fields in this resource had no effect earlier.
- Updating some fields resulted in nothing happening. This has been fixed.
- Unexpected destruction and recreation of `oci_objectstorage_object` was fixed by constraining all keys in the `metadata` map to be lower case.

### Notes
- With this release we started using the new official [OCI Go SDK](https://github.com/oracle/oci-go-sdk). Widespread changes to the source code were needed to make this happen.
- Removing optional parameters from a created resource will not result in a difference and the value for that field will remain as it was. If you want to reset the field to the default value returned by the service for that field you will have to taint the resource to destroy it and recreate it.
- If upgrading the OCI provider from v1.x.x, see [this wiki](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/wiki/Oracle-Terraform-Provider-Name-Change) for migration steps.
- See docs for this version [here](https://github.com/oracle/terraform-provider-oci/tree/v2.1.0).
