// Identity Domains API
//
// Use the Identity Domains API to manage resources within an identity domain, for example, users, dynamic resource groups, groups, and identity providers. For information about managing resources within identity domains, see Identity and Access Management (with identity domains) (https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/home.htm).
// Use this pattern to construct endpoints for identity domains: `https://<domainURL>/admin/v1/`. See Finding an Identity Domain URL (https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/api-getstarted/locate-identity-domain-url.htm) to locate the domain URL you need.
// Use the table of contents and search tool to explore the Identity Domains API.

// NotificationSettings The SCIM protocol defines a standard set of query parameters that can be used to filter, sort, and paginate to return zero or more resources in a query response.
