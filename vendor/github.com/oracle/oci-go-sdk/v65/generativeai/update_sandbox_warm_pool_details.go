// Generative AI Service Management API
//
// OCI Generative AI is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text generation, summarization, and text embeddings.
// Use the Generative AI service management API to create and manage DedicatedAiCluster, Endpoint, Model, and WorkRequest in the Generative AI service. For example, create a custom model by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box model using your own data, on a fine-tuning dedicated AI cluster. Then, create a hosting dedicated AI cluster with an endpoint to host your custom model.
// To access your custom model endpoints, or to try the out-of-the-box models to generate text, summarize, and create text embeddings see the Generative AI Inference API (https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/generative-ai-inference/latest/).
// To learn more about the service, see the Generative AI documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/generative-ai/home.htm).

Once the pool is ACTIVE, named-pool Sandbox creation can still cold-start from its available applied template when no eligible warm member is available. Reserved MANAGED default entries may be resized through the existing Project configuration workflow. Named MANAGED and CUSTOM pools use the same warm-pool lifecycle workflows. Existing customer Sandboxes continue, and unnamed Sandbox creation keeps its existing behavior.
