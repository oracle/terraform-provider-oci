// Apdex An Apdex configuration rule.
// The Apdex score is computed based on how the response time of a span compares to two predefined threshold values.
// The first threshold defines the maximum response time that is considered satisfactory for the end user.
// The second one defines the maximum response time that is considered tolerable. All times larger than that will
// be considered frustrating for the end user.
// An Apdex configuration rule works by selecting a subset of spans based on a filter expression and applying the
// two threshold comparisons to compute a score for each of the selected spans.
// The rule has an "isApplyToErrorSpans" property that controls whether or not to compute the Apdex for spans that
// have been marked as errors. If this property is set to "true", then the Apdex score for error spans is computed in
// the same way as for non-error ones. If set to "false", then computation for error spans is skipped, and the score
// is set to "frustrating" regardless of the configured thresholds. The default is "false".
// The "isEnabled" property controls whether or not an Apdex score is computed and can be used to disable Apdex
// score for certain spans. The default is "true".
// The "priority" property specifies the importance of the rule within a rule set.
// Lower values indicate a higher priority. Rules with higher priorities are evaluated first in the rule set. The
// priority of the rules must be unique within a rule set.
