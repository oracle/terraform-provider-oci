// Oracle Delegate Access Control API
//
// Oracle Delegate Access Control allows ExaCC and ExaCS customers to delegate management of their Exadata resources operators outside their tenancies.
// With Delegate Access Control, Support Providers can deliver managed services using comprehensive and robust tooling built on the OCI platform.
// Customers maintain control over who has access to the delegated resources in their tenancy and what actions can be taken.
// Enterprises managing resources across multiple tenants can use Delegate Access Control to streamline management tasks.
// Using logging service, customers can view a near real-time audit report of all actions performed by a Service Provider operator.
