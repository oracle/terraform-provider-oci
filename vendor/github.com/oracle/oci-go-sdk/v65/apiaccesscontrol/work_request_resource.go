// Oracle API Access Control
//
// This service is used to restrict the control plane service apis; so that everybody won't be
// able to access those apis.
// There are two main resouces defined as a part of this service
// 1. PrivilegedApiControl: This is created by the customer which defines which service apis are
//    controlled and who can access it.
// 2. PrivilegedApiRequest: This is a request object again created by the customer operators who           seek access to those privileged apis. After a request is obtained based on the                       PrivilegedAccessControl for which the api belongs to, either it can be approved so that the          requested person can execute the service apis or it will wait for the customer to approve it.
