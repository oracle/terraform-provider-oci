#          Issue: Use streams instead of a loop for better readability.
#          Code Block:
#
#        ```java
#            // Calculate squares of numbers
#            List<Integer> squares = new ArrayList<>();
#            for (int number : numbers) {
#              squares.add(number * number);
#            }
#          ```
#          Recommendation:
#
#        ```java
#            // Calculate squares of numbers
#            List<Integer> squares = Arrays.stream(numbers)
#              .map(n -> n * n) // Map each number to its square
#              .toList();
#          ```
#          </example>
