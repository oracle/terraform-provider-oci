# Data Source: oci_database_vm_clusters
This data source provides the list of Vm Clusters in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Lists the VM clusters in the specified compartment. Applies to Exadata Cloud@Customer instances only.
To list the cloud VM clusters in an Exadata Cloud Service instance, use the [ListCloudVmClusters ](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/database/latest/CloudVmCluster/ListCloudVmClusters) operation.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_vm_clusters" "test_vm_clusters" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.vm_cluster_display_name
	exadata_infrastructure_id = oci_database_exadata_infrastructure.test_exadata_infrastructure.id
	state = var.vm_cluster_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The compartment [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given. The match is not case sensitive.
* `exadata_infrastructure_id` - (Optional) If provided, filters the results for the given Exadata Infrastructure.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given lifecycle state exactly.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `vm_clusters` - The list of vm_clusters.

### VmCluster Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `cpus_enabled` - The number of enabled CPU cores.
* `data_storage_size_in_tbs` - Size, in terabytes, of the DATA disk group.
* `db_node_storage_size_in_gbs` - The local node storage allocated in GBs.
* `db_servers` - The list of Db server.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name for the Exadata Cloud@Customer VM cluster. The name does not need to be unique.
* `exadata_infrastructure_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Exadata infrastructure.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `gi_version` - The Oracle Grid Infrastructure software version for the VM cluster.
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM cluster.
* `is_local_backup_enabled` - If true, database backup on local Exadata storage is configured for the VM cluster. If false, database backup on local Exadata storage is not available in the VM cluster. 
* `is_sparse_diskgroup_enabled` - If true, sparse disk group is configured for the VM cluster. If false, sparse disk group is not created. 
* `last_patch_history_entry_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last patch history. This value is updated as soon as a patch operation starts.
* `license_model` - The Oracle license model that applies to the VM cluster. The default is LICENSE_INCLUDED. 
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `memory_size_in_gbs` - The memory allocated in GBs.
* `shape` - The shape of the Exadata infrastructure. The shape determines the amount of CPU, storage, and memory resources allocated to the instance. 
* `ssh_public_keys` - The public key portion of one or more key pairs used for SSH access to the VM cluster.
* `state` - The current state of the VM cluster.
* `system_version` - Operating system version of the image.
* `time_created` - The date and time that the VM cluster was created.
* `time_zone` - The time zone of the Exadata infrastructure. For details, see [Exadata Infrastructure Time Zones](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/References/timezones.htm).
* `vm_cluster_network_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM cluster network.
