# Data Source: oci_dataflow_application
This data source provides details about a specific Application resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Flow service.

Retrieves an application using an `applicationId`.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_dataflow_application" "test_application" {
	#Required
	application_id = oci_dataflow_application.test_application.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `application_id` - (Required) The unique ID for an application. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `application_log_config` - Logging details of Application logs for Data Flow Run. 
	* `log_group_id` - The log group id for where log objects will be for Data Flow Runs. 
	* `log_id` - The log id of the log object the Application Logs of Data Flow Run will be shipped to. 
* `archive_uri` - A comma separated list of one or more archive files as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure URIs. For example, ``oci://path/to/a.zip,oci://path/to/b.zip``. An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure URI of an archive.zip file containing custom dependencies that may be used to support the execution of a Python, Java, or Scala application. See https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/hdfsconnector.htm#uriformat. 
* `arguments` - The arguments passed to the running application as command line arguments.  An argument is either a plain text or a placeholder. Placeholders are replaced using values from the parameters map.  Each placeholder specified must be represented in the parameters map else the request (POST or PUT) will fail with a HTTP 400 status code.  Placeholders are specified as `Service Api Spec`, where `name` is the name of the parameter. Example:  `[ "--input", "${input_file}", "--name", "John Doe" ]` If "input_file" has a value of "mydata.xml", then the value above will be translated to `--input mydata.xml --name "John Doe"` 
* `class_name` - The class for the application. 
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of a compartment. 
* `configuration` - The Spark configuration passed to the running process. See https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#available-properties. Example: { "spark.app.name" : "My App Name", "spark.shuffle.io.maxRetries" : "4" } Note: Not all Spark properties are permitted to be set.  Attempting to set a property that is not allowed to be overwritten will cause a 400 status to be returned. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - A user-friendly description. 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. This name is not necessarily unique. 
* `driver_shape` - The VM shape for the driver. Sets the driver cores and memory. 
* `driver_shape_config` - This is used to configure the shape of the driver or executor if a flexible shape is used. 
	* `memory_in_gbs` - The amount of memory used for the driver or executors. 
	* `ocpus` - The total number of OCPUs used for the driver or executors. See [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Shape/) for details. 
* `execute` - The input used for spark-submit command. For more details see https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html#launching-applications-with-spark-submit. Supported options include ``--class``, ``--file``, ``--jars``, ``--conf``, ``--py-files``, and main application file with arguments. Example: ``--jars oci://path/to/a.jar,oci://path/to/b.jar --files oci://path/to/a.json,oci://path/to/b.csv --py-files oci://path/to/a.py,oci://path/to/b.py --conf spark.sql.crossJoin.enabled=true --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi oci://path/to/main.jar 10`` Note: If execute is specified together with applicationId, className, configuration, fileUri, language, arguments, parameters during application create/update, or run create/submit, Data Flow service will use derived information from execute input only. 
* `executor_shape` - The VM shape for the executors. Sets the executor cores and memory. 
* `executor_shape_config` - This is used to configure the shape of the driver or executor if a flexible shape is used. 
	* `memory_in_gbs` - The amount of memory used for the driver or executors. 
	* `ocpus` - The total number of OCPUs used for the driver or executors. See [here](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Shape/) for details. 
* `file_uri` - An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure URI of the file containing the application to execute. See https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/hdfsconnector.htm#uriformat. 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The application ID. 
* `idle_timeout_in_minutes` - The timeout value in minutes used to manage Runs. A Run would be stopped after inactivity for this amount of time period. Note: This parameter is currently only applicable for Runs of type `SESSION`. Default value is 2880 minutes (2 days) 
* `language` - The Spark language. 
* `logs_bucket_uri` - An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure URI of the bucket where the Spark job logs are to be uploaded. See https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/hdfsconnector.htm#uriformat. 
* `max_duration_in_minutes` - The maximum duration in minutes for which an Application should run. Data Flow Run would be terminated once it reaches this duration from the time it transitions to `IN_PROGRESS` state. 
* `metastore_id` - The OCID of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Hive Metastore. 
* `num_executors` - The number of executor VMs requested. 
* `owner_principal_id` - The OCID of the user who created the resource. 
* `owner_user_name` - The username of the user who created the resource.  If the username of the owner does not exist, `null` will be returned and the caller should refer to the ownerPrincipalId value instead. 
* `parameters` - An array of name/value pairs used to fill placeholders found in properties like `Application.arguments`.  The name must be a string of one or more word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _).  The value can be a string of 0 or more characters of any kind. Example:  [ { name: "iterations", value: "10"}, { name: "input_file", value: "mydata.xml" }, { name: "variable_x", value: "${x}"} ] 
	* `name` - The name of the parameter.  It must be a string of one or more word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _). Examples: "iterations", "input_file" 
	* `value` - The value of the parameter. It must be a string of 0 or more characters of any kind. Examples: "" (empty string), "10", "mydata.xml", "${x}" 
* `pool_id` - The OCID of a pool. Unique Id to indentify a dataflow pool resource. 
* `private_endpoint_id` - The OCID of a private endpoint. 
* `spark_version` - The Spark version utilized to run the application. 
* `state` - The current state of this application. 
* `time_created` - The date and time the resource was created, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. Example: `2018-04-03T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `time_updated` - The date and time the resource was updated, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp format. Example: `2018-04-03T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `type` - The Spark application processing type. 
* `warehouse_bucket_uri` - An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure URI of the bucket to be used as default warehouse directory for BATCH SQL runs. See https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/hdfsconnector.htm#uriformat. 
* `terminate_runs_on_deletion` - A boolean flag which indicates whether related non-terminal Run(s) for the Application should be terminated along with Application deletion or not.
