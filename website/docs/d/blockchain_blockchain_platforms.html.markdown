# Data Source: oci_blockchain_blockchain_platforms
This data source provides the list of Blockchain Platforms in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Blockchain service.

Returns a list Blockchain Platform Instances in a compartment

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_blockchain_blockchain_platforms" "test_blockchain_platforms" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.blockchain_platform_display_name
	state = var.blockchain_platform_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Example: `My new resource` 
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to only return resources that match the given lifecycle state. The state value is case-insensitive.
