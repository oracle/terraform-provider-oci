# Data Source: oci_devops_deploy_stages
This data source provides the list of Deploy Stages in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Devops service.

Retrieves a list of deployment stages.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_devops_deploy_stages" "test_deploy_stages" {

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	deploy_pipeline_id = oci_devops_deploy_pipeline.test_deploy_pipeline.id
	display_name = var.deploy_stage_display_name
	id = var.deploy_stage_id
	state = var.deploy_stage_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `deploy_pipeline_id` - (Optional) The ID of the parent pipeline.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `id` - (Optional) Unique identifier or OCID for listing a single resource by ID.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only deployment stages that matches the given lifecycle state.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `deploy_stage_collection` - The list of deploy_stage_collection.

### DeployStage Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `approval_policy` - Specifies the approval policy.
	* `approval_policy_type` - Approval policy type.
	* `number_of_approvals_required` - A minimum number of approvals required for stage to proceed.
* `blue_backend_ips` - Collection of backend environment IP addresses.
	* `items` - The IP address of the backend server. A server could be a compute instance or a load balancer.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of a compartment.
* `compute_instance_group_deploy_environment_id` - A compute instance group environment OCID for rolling deployment.
* `config` - User provided key and value pair configuration, which is assigned through constants or parameter.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}`
* `deploy_artifact_id` - Optional binary artifact OCID user may provide to this stage.
* `deploy_artifact_ids` - Additional file artifact OCIDs.
* `deploy_pipeline_id` - The OCID of a pipeline.
* `deploy_stage_predecessor_collection` - Collection containing the predecessors of a stage.
	* `items` - A list of stage predecessors for a stage.
		* `id` - The OCID of the predecessor stage. If a stage is the first stage in the pipeline, then the ID is the pipeline's OCID.
* `deploy_stage_type` - Deployment stage type.
* `deployment_spec_deploy_artifact_id` - The OCID of the artifact that contains the deployment specification.
* `description` - Optional description about the deployment stage.
* `display_name` - Deployment stage display name, which can be renamed and is not necessarily unique. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `docker_image_deploy_artifact_id` - A Docker image artifact OCID.
* `failure_policy` - Specifies a failure policy for a compute instance group rolling deployment stage.
	* `failure_count` - The threshold count of failed instances in the group, which when reached or exceeded sets the stage as FAILED.
	* `failure_percentage` - The failure percentage threshold, which when reached or exceeded sets the stage as FAILED. Percentage is computed as the ceiling value of the number of failed instances over the total count of the instances in the group.
	* `policy_type` - Specifies if the failure instance size is given by absolute number or by percentage.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only.  See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}`
* `function_deploy_environment_id` - Function environment OCID.
* `function_timeout_in_seconds` - Timeout for execution of the Function. Value in seconds.
* `green_backend_ips` - Collection of backend environment IP addresses.
	* `items` - The IP address of the backend server. A server could be a compute instance or a load balancer.
* `id` - Unique identifier that is immutable on creation.
* `is_async` - A boolean flag specifies whether this stage executes asynchronously.
* `is_validation_enabled` - A boolean flag specifies whether the invoked function must be validated.
* `kubernetes_manifest_deploy_artifact_ids` - List of Kubernetes manifest artifact OCIDs, the manifests should not include any job resource.
* `lifecycle_details` - A message describing the current state in more detail. For example, can be used to provide actionable information for a resource in Failed state.
* `load_balancer_config` - Specifies config for load balancer traffic shift stages.
	* `backend_port` - Listen port for the backend server.
	* `listener_name` - Name of the load balancer listener.
	* `load_balancer_id` - The OCID of the load balancer.
* `max_memory_in_mbs` - Maximum usable memory for the Function (in MB).
* `namespace` - Default Namespace to be used for Kubernetes deployment when not specified in the manifest.
* `oke_cluster_deploy_environment_id` - Kubernetes cluster environment OCID for deployment.
* `project_id` - The OCID of a project.
* `rollback_policy` - Specifies the rollback policy. This is initiated on the failure of certain stage types.
	* `policy_type` - Specifies type of the deployment stage rollback policy.
* `rollout_policy` - Description of rollout policy for load balancer traffic shift stage.
	* `batch_count` - The number that will be used to determine how many instances will be deployed concurrently.
	* `batch_delay_in_seconds` - The duration of delay between batch rollout. The default delay is 1 minute.
	* `batch_percentage` - The percentage that will be used to determine how many instances will be deployed concurrently.
	* `policy_type` - The type of policy used for rolling out a deployment stage.
	* `ramp_limit_percent` - Indicates the criteria to stop.
* `state` - The current state of the deployment stage.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}`
