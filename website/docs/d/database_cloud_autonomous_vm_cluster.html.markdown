License Included allows you to subscribe to new Oracle AI Database software licenses and the Oracle AI Database service. Note that when provisioning an [Autonomous AI Database on dedicated Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/index.html), this attribute must be null. It is already set at the Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure level. When provisioning an [Autonomous AI Database Serverless] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/index.html) database, if a value is not specified, the system defaults the value to `BRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE`. Bring your own license (BYOL) also allows you to select the DB edition using the optional parameter.

	This cannot be updated in parallel with any of the following: cpuCoreCount, computeCount, maxCpuCoreCount, dataStorageSizeInTBs, adminPassword, isMTLSConnectionRequired, dbWorkload, privateEndpointLabel, nsgIds, dbVersion, dbName, scheduledOperations, dbToolsDetails, or isFreeTier. 
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `maintenance_window` - The scheduling details for the quarterly maintenance window. Patching and system updates take place during the maintenance window.

	* `days_of_week` - Days during the week when maintenance should be performed.
		* `name` - Name of the day of the week.
	* `hours_of_day` - The window of hours during the day when maintenance should be performed. The window is a 4 hour slot. Valid values are
		* 0 - represents time slot 0:00 - 3:59 UTC - 4 - represents time slot 4:00 - 7:59 UTC - 8 - represents time slot 8:00 - 11:59 UTC - 12 - represents time slot 12:00 - 15:59 UTC - 16 - represents time slot 16:00 - 19:59 UTC - 20 - represents time slot 20:00 - 23:59 UTC
	* `is_custom_action_timeout_enabled` - If true, enables the configuration of a custom action timeout (waiting period) between database server patching operations.
	* `is_monthly_patching_enabled` - If true, enables the monthly patching option.
	* `lead_time_in_weeks` - Lead time window allows user to set a lead time to prepare for a down time. The lead time is in weeks and valid value is between 1 to 4. 
	* `months` - Months during the year when maintenance should be performed.
		* `name` - Name of the month of the year.
	* `patching_mode` - Cloud Exadata infrastructure node patching method, either "ROLLING" or "NONROLLING". Default value is ROLLING.

Weeks start and end based on calendar dates, not days of the week. For example, to allow maintenance during the 2nd week of the month (from the 8th day to the 14th day of the month), use the value 2. Maintenance cannot be scheduled for the fifth week of months that contain more than 28 days. Note that this parameter works in conjunction with the  daysOfWeek and hoursOfDay parameters to allow you to specify specific days of the week and hours that maintenance will be performed.
* `max_acds_lowest_scaled_value` - The lowest value to which maximum number of ACDs can be scaled down.
