# Data Source: oci_datascience_model_version_sets
This data source provides the list of Model Version Sets in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science service.

Lists model version sets in the specified compartment.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_datascience_model_version_sets" "test_model_version_sets" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	category = var.model_version_set_category
	created_by = var.model_version_set_created_by
	id = var.model_version_set_id
	name = var.model_version_set_name
	project_id = oci_datascience_project.test_project.id
	state = var.model_version_set_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `category` - (Optional) Specifies the type of model version sets to list. By default, user model version sets are listed. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) <b>Filter</b> results by the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `created_by` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the user who created the resource.
* `id` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm). Must be an OCID of the correct type for the resource type. 
* `name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire name given.
* `project_id` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the project.
* `state` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by the specified lifecycle state. Must be a valid state for the resource type. 


## Attributes Reference
