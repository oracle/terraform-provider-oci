# Data Source: oci_database_external_database_connector
This data source provides details about a specific External Database Connector resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets information about the specified external database connector.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_external_database_connector" "test_external_database_connector" {
	#Required
	external_database_connector_id = oci_database_external_database_connector.test_external_database_connector.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `external_database_connector_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the external database connector resource (`ExternalDatabaseConnectorId`). 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `connection_credentials` - Credentials used to connect to the database. Currently only the `DETAILS` type is supported for creating MACS connector crendentials. 
	* `credential_name` - The name of the credential information that used to connect to the database. The name should be in "x.y" format, where the length of "x" has a maximum of 64 characters, and length of "y" has a maximum of 199 characters. The name strings can contain letters, numbers and the underscore character only. Other characters are not valid, except for the "." character that separates the "x" and "y" portions of the name. *IMPORTANT* - The name must be unique within the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region the credential is being created in. If you specify a name that duplicates the name of another credential within the same Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region, you may overwrite or corrupt the credential that is already using the name.

		For example: inventorydb.abc112233445566778899 
	* `credential_type` - The type of credential used to connect to the database.
	* `password` - The password that will be used to connect to the database.
	* `role` - The role of the user that will be connecting to the database.
	* `ssl_secret_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [secret](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm#concepts).
	* `username` - The username that will be used to connect to the database.
* `connection_status` - The status of connectivity to the external database.

* `connector_agent_id` - The ID of the agent used for the [external database connector](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/database/latest/datatypes/CreateExternalDatabaseConnectorDetails). 
* `connector_type` - The type of connector used by the external database resource.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).
