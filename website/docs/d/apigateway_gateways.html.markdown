# Data Source: oci_apigateway_gateways
This data source provides the list of Gateways in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API Gateway service.

Returns a list of gateways.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_apigateway_gateways" "test_gateways" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
    certificate_id = var.oci_apigateway_certificate.test_certificate.id
	display_name = var.gateway_display_name
	state = var.gateway_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `certificate_id` - (Optional) Filter gateways by the certificate ocid.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ocid of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.  Example: `My new resource` 
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given lifecycle state.  Example: `SUCCEEDED`
