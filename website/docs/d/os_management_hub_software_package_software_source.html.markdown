# Data Source: oci_os_management_hub_software_package_software_source
This data source provides the list of Software Package Software Source in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Os Management Hub service.

Lists the software sources in the tenancy that contain the software package. Filter the list against a
variety of criteria including but not limited to its name, type, architecture, and OS family.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_os_management_hub_software_package_software_source" "test_software_package_software_source" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	software_package_name = oci_os_management_hub_software_package.test_software_package.name

	#Optional
	arch_type = var.software_package_software_source_arch_type
	availability = var.software_package_software_source_availability
	availability_anywhere = var.software_package_software_source_availability_anywhere
	availability_at_oci = var.software_package_software_source_availability_at_oci
	display_name = var.software_package_software_source_display_name
	display_name_contains = var.software_package_software_source_display_name_contains
	os_family = var.software_package_software_source_os_family
	software_source_type = var.software_package_software_source_software_source_type
	state = var.software_package_software_source_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `arch_type` - (Optional) A filter to return only instances whose architecture type matches the given architecture.
* `availability` - (Optional) The availability of the software source in a non-OCI environment for a tenancy.
