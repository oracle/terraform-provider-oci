# Data Source: oci_containerengine_clusters
This data source provides the list of Clusters in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine service.

List all the cluster objects in a compartment.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_containerengine_clusters" "test_clusters" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	name = var.cluster_name
	state = var.cluster_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment.
* `name` - (Optional) The name to filter on.
* `state` - (Optional) A cluster lifecycle state to filter on. Can have multiple parameters of this name.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

		* `is_tiller_enabled` - Whether or not to enable the Tiller add-on.
	* `admission_controller_options` - Configurable cluster admission controllers
		* `is_pod_security_policy_enabled` - Whether or not to enable the Pod Security Policy admission controller.

However, claims  other than email will be prefixed with the issuer URL to prevent naming clashes with other plugins. 
		* `username_prefix` - Prefix prepended to username claims to prevent clashes with existing names (such as system:users).  For example, the value oidc: will create usernames like oidc:jane.doe. If this flag isn't provided and  --oidc-username-claim is a value other than email the prefix defaults to ( Issuer URL )# where  ( Issuer URL ) is the value of --oidc-issuer-url. The value - can be used to disable all prefixing.

	* `persistent_volume_config` - Configuration to be applied to block volumes created by Kubernetes Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
		* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}`
