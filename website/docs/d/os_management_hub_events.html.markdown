This data source provides the list of Events in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Os Management Hub service.

Lists events that match the specified criteria, such as compartment, state, and event type.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_os_management_hub_events" "test_events" {

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	event_fingerprint = var.event_event_fingerprint
	event_summary = var.event_event_summary
	event_summary_contains = var.event_event_summary_contains
	id = var.event_id
	is_managed_by_autonomous_linux = var.event_is_managed_by_autonomous_linux
	resource_id = oci_usage_proxy_resource.test_resource.id
	state = var.event_state
	time_created_greater_than_or_equal_to = var.event_time_created_greater_than_or_equal_to
	time_created_less_than = var.event_time_created_less_than
	type = var.event_type
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
