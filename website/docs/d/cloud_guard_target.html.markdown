# Data Source: oci_cloud_guard_target
This data source provides details about a specific Target resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Guard service.

Returns a target (Target resource) identified by targetId.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_cloud_guard_target" "test_target" {
	#Required
	target_id = oci_cloud_guard_target.test_target.id
}
```

The following arguments are supported:

* `target_id` - (Required) OCID of the target


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:
