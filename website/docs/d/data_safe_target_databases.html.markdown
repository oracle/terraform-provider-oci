# Data Source: oci_data_safe_target_databases
This data source provides the list of Target Databases in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Returns the list of registered target databases in Data Safe.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_data_safe_target_databases" "test_target_databases" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	access_level = var.target_database_access_level
	associated_resource_id = oci_data_safe_associated_resource.test_associated_resource.id
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.target_database_compartment_id_in_subtree
	database_type = var.target_database_database_type
	display_name = var.target_database_display_name
	infrastructure_type = var.target_database_infrastructure_type
	state = var.target_database_state
	target_database_id = oci_data_safe_target_database.test_target_database.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `access_level` - (Optional) Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED. Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed. 
* `associated_resource_id` - (Optional) A filter to return the target databases that are associated to the resource id passed in as a parameter value.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) A filter to return only resources that match the specified compartment OCID.
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned. Depends on the 'accessLevel' setting. 
* `database_type` - (Optional) A filter to return only target databases that match the specified database type.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the specified display name. 
* `infrastructure_type` - (Optional) A filter to return only target databases that match the specified infrastructure type.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only target databases that match the specified lifecycle state.
* `target_database_id` - (Optional) A filter to return the target database that matches the specified OCID.
