# Data Source: oci_database_management_managed_databases
This data source provides the list of Managed Databases in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Management service.

Gets the Managed Database for a specific ID or the list of Managed Databases in a specific compartment.
Managed Databases can be filtered based on the name parameter. Only one of the parameters, ID or name
should be provided. If neither of these parameters is provided, all the Managed Databases in the compartment
are listed. Managed Databases can also be filtered based on the deployment type and management option.
If the deployment type is not specified or if it is `ONPREMISE`, then the management option is not
considered and Managed Databases with `ADVANCED` management option are listed.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_management_managed_databases" "test_managed_databases" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	deployment_type = var.managed_database_deployment_type
	external_exadata_infrastructure_id = oci_database_management_external_exadata_infrastructure.test_external_exadata_infrastructure.id
	id = var.managed_database_id
	management_option = var.managed_database_management_option
	name = var.managed_database_name
}
```

	* `connector_details` - The connector details required to connect to an Oracle cloud database.
		* `connector_type` - The list of supported connection types:
			* PE: Private endpoint
			* MACS: Management agent
			* EXTERNAL: External database connector 
		* `database_connector_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the external database connector.
