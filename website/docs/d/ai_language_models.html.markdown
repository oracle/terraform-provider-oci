# Data Source: oci_ai_language_models
This data source provides the list of Models in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ai Language service.

Returns a list of models.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_ai_language_models" "test_models" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.model_display_name
	model_id = oci_ai_language_model.test_model.id
	project_id = oci_ai_language_project.test_project.id
	state = var.model_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `model_id` - (Optional) unique model OCID.
* `project_id` - (Optional) The ID of the project for which to list the objects.
* `state` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by the specified lifecycle state. Must be a valid state for the resource type. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `model_collection` - The list of model_collection.

### Model Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)  for the model's compartment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - A short description of the Model.
* `display_name` - A user-friendly display name for the resource. It does not have to be unique and can be modified. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `evaluation_results` - model training results of different models
	* `class_metrics` - List of text classification metrics
		* `f1` - F1-score, is a measure of a model’s accuracy on a dataset

		* `precision` - Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive predictions (i.e., the number of true positives plus the number of false positives)
		* `recall` - Measures the model's ability to predict actual positive classes. It is the ratio between the predicted true positives and what was actually tagged. The recall metric reveals how many of the predicted classes are correct.
	* `labels` - labels
	* `metrics` - Model level named entity recognition metrics
		* `accuracy` - The fraction of the labels that were correctly recognised .
		* `macro_f1` - F1-score, is a measure of a model’s accuracy on a dataset
		* `macro_precision` - Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive predictions (i.e., the number of true positives plus the number of false positives)
		* `macro_recall` - Measures the model's ability to predict actual positive classes. It is the ratio between the predicted true positives and what was actually tagged. The recall metric reveals how many of the predicted classes are correct.
		* `micro_f1` - F1-score, is a measure of a model’s accuracy on a dataset
		* `micro_precision` - Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive predictions (i.e., the number of true positives plus the number of false positives)
		* `micro_recall` - Measures the model's ability to predict actual positive classes. It is the ratio between the predicted true positives and what was actually tagged. The recall metric reveals how many of the predicted classes are correct.
		* `weighted_f1` - F1-score, is a measure of a model’s accuracy on a dataset
		* `weighted_precision` - Precision refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive predictions (i.e., the number of true positives plus the number of false positives)
		* `weighted_recall` - Measures the model's ability to predict actual positive classes. It is the ratio between the predicted true positives and what was actually tagged. The recall metric reveals how many of the predicted classes are correct.
	* `model_type` - Model type
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}`
