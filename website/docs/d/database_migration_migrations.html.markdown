# Data Source: oci_database_migration_migrations
This data source provides the list of Migrations in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Migration service.

List all Migrations.

Note: If you wish to use the DMS deprecated API version /20210929 it is necessary to pin the Terraform Provider version to v5.47.0. Newer Terraform provider versions will not support the DMS deprecated API version /20210929

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_migration_migrations" "test_migrations" {

	#Optional
	display_name = var.migration_display_name
	lifecycle_details = var.migration_lifecycle_details
	state = var.migration_state
}
