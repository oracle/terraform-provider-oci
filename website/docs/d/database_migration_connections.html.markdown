# Data Source: oci_database_migration_connections
This data source provides the list of Connections in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Migration service.

List all Database Connections.

Note: If you wish to use the DMS deprecated API version /20210929 it is necessary to pin the Terraform Provider version to v5.47.0. Newer Terraform provider versions will not support the DMS deprecated API version /20210929

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_migration_connections" "test_connections" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	connection_type = var.connection_connection_type
	display_name = var.connection_display_name
	source_connection_id = oci_database_migration_connection.test_connection.id
	state = var.connection_state
	technology_type = var.connection_technology_type
}
```

## Argument Reference
