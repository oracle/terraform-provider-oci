# Data Source: oci_core_compute_hosts
This data source provides the list of Compute Hosts in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Generates a list of summary host details


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_compute_hosts" "test_compute_hosts" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	availability_domain = var.compute_host_availability_domain
	compute_host_health = var.compute_host_compute_host_health
	compute_host_lifecycle_state = var.compute_host_compute_host_lifecycle_state
	display_name = var.compute_host_display_name
	network_resource_id = oci_cloud_guard_resource.test_resource.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_domain` - (Optional) The name of the availability domain.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `compute_host_health` - (Optional) A filter to return only ComputeHostSummary resources that match the given Compute Host health State OCID exactly. 
* `compute_host_lifecycle_state` - (Optional) A filter to return only ComputeHostSummary resources that match the given Compute Host lifecycle State OCID exactly. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly. 
* `network_resource_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compute host network resoruce.
	* Customer-unique HPC island ID
	* Customer-unique network block ID
	* Customer-unique local block ID 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compute_host_collection` - The list of compute_host_collection.

### ComputeHost Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `additional_data` - Additional data that can be exposed to the customer.  Will include raw fault codes for strategic customers 
* `availability_domain` - The availability domain of the compute host.  Example: `Uocm:US-CHICAGO-1-AD-2` 
* `capacity_reservation_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the Capacity Reserver that is currently on host 
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the compartment. This should always be the root compartment. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `fault_domain` - A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.

	This field is the Fault domain of the host 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `health` - The heathy state of the host 
* `hpc_island_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for Customer-unique HPC Island 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the Customer-unique host 
* `impacted_component_details` - A list that contains impacted components related to an unhealthy host. An impacted component will be a  free-form structure of key values pairs that will provide more or less details based on data tiering 
* `instance_id` - The public [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the Virtual Machine or Bare Metal instance 
* `lifecycle_details` - A free-form description detailing why the host is in its current state. 
* `local_block_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for Customer-unique Local Block 
* `gpu_memory_fabric_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for Customer-unique GPU Memory Fabric
* `network_block_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for Customer-unique Network Block 
* `shape` - The shape of host 
* `state` - The lifecycle state of the host 
* `time_created` - The date and time that the compute host record was created, in the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools .ietf.org/html/rfc3339).  Example: `2016-08-25T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `time_updated` - The date and time that the compute host record was updated, in the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).  Example: `2016-08-25T21:10:29.600Z`
