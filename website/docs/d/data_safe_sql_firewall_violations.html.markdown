# Data Source: oci_data_safe_sql_firewall_violations
This data source provides the list of Sql Firewall Violations in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Gets a list of all the SQL Firewall violations captured by the firewall.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_data_safe_sql_firewall_violations" "test_sql_firewall_violations" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	access_level = var.sql_firewall_violation_access_level
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.sql_firewall_violation_compartment_id_in_subtree
	scim_query = var.sql_firewall_violation_scim_query
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `access_level` - (Optional) Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED. Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) A filter to return only resources that match the specified compartment OCID.
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned. Depends on the 'accessLevel' setting. 
* `scim_query` - (Optional) The scimQuery query parameter accepts filter expressions that use the syntax described in Section 3.2.2.2 of the System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification, which is available at [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-scim-api-12). In SCIM filtering expressions, text, date, and time values must be enclosed in quotation marks, with date and time values using ISO-8601 format. (Numeric and boolean values should not be quoted.)

	**Example:** query=(operationTime ge "2021-06-04T01:00:26.000Z") and (violationAction eq "BLOCKED")
