### CloudVmCluster Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `availability_domain` - The name of the availability domain that the cloud Exadata infrastructure resource is located in.
* `backup_network_nsg_ids` - A list of the [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network security groups (NSGs) that the backup network of this DB system belongs to. Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see [Security Rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm). Applicable only to Exadata systems. 
* `backup_subnet_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup network subnet associated with the cloud VM cluster.

	**Subnet Restriction:** See the subnet restrictions information for **subnetId**. 
* `cloud_automation_update_details` - Specifies the properties necessary for cloud automation updates. This includes modifying the apply update time preference, enabling or disabling early adoption, and enabling, modifying, or disabling the update freeze period. 
	* `apply_update_time_preference` - Configure the time slot for applying VM cloud automation software updates to the cluster. When nothing is selected, the default time slot is 12 AM to 2 AM UTC. Any 2-hour slot is available starting at 12 AM. 
		* `apply_update_preferred_end_time` - End time for polling VM cloud automation software updates for the cluster. If the endTime is not specified, 2 AM UTC is used by default. 
		* `apply_update_preferred_start_time` - Start time for polling VM cloud automation software updates for the cluster. If the startTime is not specified, 12 AM UTC is used by default. 
	* `freeze_period` - Enables a freeze period for the VM cluster prohibiting the VMs from getting cloud automation software updates during critical business cycles. Freeze period start date. Starts at 12:00 AM UTC on the selected date and ends at 11:59:59 PM UTC on the selected date. Validates to ensure the freeze period does not exceed 45 days. 
		* `freeze_period_end_time` - End time of the freeze period cycle. 
		* `freeze_period_start_time` - Start time of the freeze period cycle. 
	* `is_early_adoption_enabled` - Annotates whether the cluster should be part of early access to apply VM cloud automation software updates. Those clusters annotated as early access will download the software bits for cloud automation in the first week after the update is available, while other clusters will have to wait until the following week. 
	* `is_freeze_period_enabled` - Specifies if the freeze period is enabled for the VM cluster to prevent the VMs from receiving cloud automation software updates during critical business cycles. Freeze period starts at 12:00 AM UTC and ends at 11:59:59 PM UTC on the selected date. Ensure that the freezing period does not exceed 45 days.

Enabling diagnostic collection allows you to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues. Diagnostic collection also allows Oracle to provide enhanced service and proactive support for your Exadata system. You can enable diagnostic collection during VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster provisioning. You can also disable or enable it at any time using the `UpdateVmCluster` or `updateCloudVmCluster` API. 
    * `is_health_monitoring_enabled` - Indicates whether health monitoring is enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling health monitoring allows Oracle to collect diagnostic data and share it with its operations and support personnel. You may also receive notifications for some events. Collecting health diagnostics enables Oracle to provide proactive support and enhanced service for your system. Optionally enable health monitoring while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable health monitoring anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `UpdateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
    * `is_incident_logs_enabled` - Indicates whether incident logs and trace collection are enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling incident logs collection allows Oracle to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues, collect incident logs and traces, and use them to diagnose issues and resolve them.
