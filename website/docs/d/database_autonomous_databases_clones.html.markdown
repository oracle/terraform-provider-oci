Only clients connecting from an IP address included in the ACL may access the Autonomous Database instance. If `arePrimaryWhitelistedIpsUsed` is 'TRUE' then Autonomous Database uses this primary's IP access control list (ACL) for the disaster recovery peer called `standbywhitelistedips`.

  For Autonomous Database Serverless, this is an array of CIDR (classless inter-domain routing) notations for a subnet or VCN OCID (virtual cloud network Oracle Cloud ID). Use a semicolon (;) as a deliminator between the VCN-specific subnets or IPs. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id>","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id1>;1.1.1.1","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id2>;1.1.0.0/16"]` For Exadata Cloud@Customer, this is an array of IP addresses or CIDR notations. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","1.1.2.25"]`

  For an update operation, if you want to delete all the IPs in the ACL, use an array with a single empty string entry.

  This cannot be updated in parallel with any of the following: licenseModel, dbEdition, cpuCoreCount, computeCount, computeModel, adminPassword, isMTLSConnectionRequired, openMode, permissionLevel, dbWorkload, dbVersion, isRefreshable, dbName, scheduledOperations, dbToolsDetails, isLocalDataGuardEnabled, or isFreeTier.
* `state` - The current state of the Autonomous Database.
* `subnet_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet the resource is associated with.

  **Subnet Restrictions:**
	* For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28.
	* For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node RAC systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.
	* For Autonomous Database, setting this will disable public secure access to the database.

  These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet.

This feature is available for [Autonomous Database Serverless] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/index.html) and on Exadata Cloud@Customer. Only clients connecting from an IP address included in the ACL may access the Autonomous Database instance. If `arePrimaryWhitelistedIpsUsed` is 'TRUE' then Autonomous Database uses this primary's IP access control list (ACL) for the disaster recovery peer called `standbywhitelistedips`.

  For Autonomous Database Serverless, this is an array of CIDR (classless inter-domain routing) notations for a subnet or VCN OCID (virtual cloud network Oracle Cloud ID). Use a semicolon (;) as a deliminator between the VCN-specific subnets or IPs. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id>","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id1>;1.1.1.1","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id2>;1.1.0.0/16"]` For Exadata Cloud@Customer, this is an array of IP addresses or CIDR notations. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","1.1.2.25"]`

  For an update operation, if you want to delete all the IPs in the ACL, use an array with a single empty string entry.
