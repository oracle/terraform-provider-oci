# Data Source: oci_database_db_system_storage_performances
This data source provides the list of Db System Storage Performances in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets a list of possible expected storage performance parameters of a VMDB System based on Configuration.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_db_system_storage_performances" "test_db_system_storage_performances" {
	#Required
	storage_management = var.db_system_storage_performance_storage_management

	#Optional
	shape_type = var.db_system_storage_performance_shape_type

	#Optional
	daatabase_edition = var.db_system_storage_performance_database_edition

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `shape_type` - (Optional) Optional. Filters the performance results by shape type.
* `storage_management` - (Required) The DB system storage management option. Used to list database versions available for that storage manager. Valid values are `ASM` and `LVM`.
	* ASM specifies Oracle Automatic Storage Management
	* LVM specifies logical volume manager, sometimes called logical disk manager. 
* `database_edition` - (Optional) Optional. Filters the performance results by database edition. Valid values are:
	* STANDARD_EDITION
	* ENTERPRISE_EDITION
	* ENTERPRISE_EDITION_HIGH_PERFORMANCE
	* ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME
	* ENTERPRISE_EDITION_DEVELOPER
* `compartment_id` - (Optional) Optional. The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
