# Data Source: oci_data_safe_security_assessments
This data source provides the list of Security Assessments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Gets a list of security assessments.

The ListSecurityAssessments operation returns only the assessments in the specified `compartmentId`.
The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.

The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
`compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.

The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListSecurityAssessments on the
`compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_data_safe_security_assessments" "test_security_assessments" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	access_level = var.security_assessment_access_level
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.security_assessment_compartment_id_in_subtree
	display_name = var.security_assessment_display_name
	is_baseline = var.security_assessment_is_baseline
	is_schedule_assessment = var.security_assessment_is_schedule_assessment
	schedule_assessment_id = oci_data_safe_schedule_assessment.test_schedule_assessment.id
	state = var.security_assessment_state
	target_id = oci_cloud_guard_target.test_target.id
	time_created_greater_than_or_equal_to = var.security_assessment_time_created_greater_than_or_equal_to
	time_created_less_than = var.security_assessment_time_created_less_than
	triggered_by = var.security_assessment_triggered_by
	type = var.security_assessment_type
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `access_level` - (Optional) Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED. Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) A filter to return only resources that match the specified compartment OCID.
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned. Depends on the 'accessLevel' setting. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the specified display name. 
* `is_baseline` - (Optional) A filter to return only the security assessments that are set as a baseline.
* `is_schedule_assessment` - (Optional) A filter to return only security assessments of type save schedule. 
* `schedule_assessment_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the security assessment of type SAVE_SCHEDULE.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the specified lifecycle state.
* `target_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only items related to a specific target OCID.
* `time_created_greater_than_or_equal_to` - (Optional) A filter to return only the resources that were created after the specified date and time, as defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). Using TimeCreatedGreaterThanOrEqualToQueryParam parameter retrieves all resources created after that date.

	**Example:** 2016-12-19T16:39:57.600Z 
* `time_created_less_than` - (Optional) Search for resources that were created before a specific date. Specifying this parameter corresponding `timeCreatedLessThan` parameter will retrieve all resources created before the specified created date, in "YYYY-MM-ddThh:mmZ" format with a Z offset, as defined by RFC 3339.

	**Example:** 2016-12-19T16:39:57.600Z 
* `triggered_by` - (Optional) A filter to return only security asessments that were created by either user or system.
* `type` - (Optional) A filter to return only items that match the specified security assessment type.

This type keeps an up-to-date assessment of all database risks in one compartment. It is automatically updated when the latest assessment or refresh action is executed. It is also automatically updated when a target is deleted or move to a different compartment.
