# Data Source: oci_datascience_job_run
This data source provides details about a specific Job Run resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science service.

Gets a job run.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_datascience_job_run" "test_job_run" {
	#Required
	job_run_id = oci_datascience_job_run.test_job_run.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `job_run_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the job run.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment where you want to create the job run.
* `created_by` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the user who created the job run.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly display name for the resource.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the job run.
* `job_configuration_override_details` - The job configuration details 
	* `command_line_arguments` - The arguments to pass to the job. 
	* `environment_variables` - Environment variables to set for the job. 
	* `job_type` - The type of job.
	* `maximum_runtime_in_minutes` - A time bound for the execution of the job. Timer starts when the job becomes active. 
* `job_environment_configuration_override_details` - Environment configuration to capture job runtime dependencies.
	* `cmd` - The container image run [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) as a list of strings. Use `CMD` as arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT` or the only command to run in the absence of an `ENTRYPOINT`. The combined size of `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` must be less than 2048 bytes. 
	* `entrypoint` - The container image run [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) as a list of strings. Accept the `CMD` as extra arguments. The combined size of `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` must be less than 2048 bytes. More information on how `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` interact are [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#understand-how-cmd-and-entrypoint-interact). 
	* `image` - The full path to the Oracle Container Repository (OCIR) registry, image, and tag in a canonical format. Acceptable format: `<region>.ocir.io/<registry>/<image>:<tag>` `<region>.ocir.io/<registry>/<image>:<tag>@digest` 
	* `image_digest` - The digest of the container image. For example, `sha256:881303a6b2738834d795a32b4a98eb0e5e3d1cad590a712d1e04f9b2fa90a030`
