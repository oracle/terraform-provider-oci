# Data Source: oci_datascience_model_deployments
This data source provides the list of Model Deployments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Datascience service.

Lists all model deployments in the specified compartment. Only one parameter other than compartmentId may also be included in a query. The query must include compartmentId. If the query does not include compartmentId, or includes compartmentId but two or more other parameters an error is returned.

				* `initial_instance_count` - For a threshold-based autoscaling policy, this value is the initial number of instances to launch in the model deployment immediately after autoscaling is enabled. Note that anytime this value is updated, the number of instances will be reset to this value. After autoscaling retrieves performance metrics, the number of instances is automatically adjusted from this initial number to a number that is based on the limits that you set. 
				* `maximum_instance_count` - For a threshold-based autoscaling policy, this value is the maximum number of instances the model deployment is allowed to increase to (scale out). 
				* `minimum_instance_count` - For a threshold-based autoscaling policy, this value is the minimum number of instances the model deployment is allowed to decrease to (scale in). 
				* `rules` - The list of autoscaling policy rules. 
					* `metric_expression_rule_type` - The metric expression for creating the alarm used to trigger autoscaling actions on the model deployment.

						The following values are supported:
						* `PREDEFINED_EXPRESSION`: An expression built using CPU or Memory metrics emitted by the Model Deployment Monitoring.
						* `CUSTOM_EXPRESSION`: A custom Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression. 
					* `metric_type` - Metric type 
					* `scale_in_configuration` - The scaling configuration for the predefined metric expression rule. 
						* `instance_count_adjustment` - The value is used for adjusting the count of instances by. 
						* `pending_duration` - The period of time that the condition defined in the alarm must persist before the alarm state changes from "OK" to "FIRING" or vice versa. For example, a value of 5 minutes means that the alarm must persist in breaching the condition for five minutes before the alarm updates its state to "FIRING"; likewise, the alarm must persist in not breaching the condition for five minutes before the alarm updates its state to "OK."

							The duration is specified as a string in ISO 8601 format (`PT10M` for ten minutes or `PT1H` for one hour). Minimum: PT3M. Maximum: PT1H. Default: PT3M. 
						* `query` - The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to evaluate for the alarm. The Alarms feature of the Monitoring service interprets results for each returned time series as Boolean values, where zero represents false and a non-zero value represents true. A true value means that the trigger rule condition has been met. The query must specify a metric, statistic, interval, and trigger rule (threshold or absence). Supported values for interval: `1m`-`60m` (also `1h`). You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: `grouping()`, `groupBy()`.

							Example of threshold alarm:

							-----

							CPUUtilization[1m]{resourceId = "MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_OCID"}.grouping().mean() < 25 CPUUtilization[1m]{resourceId = "MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_OCID"}.grouping().mean() > 75

							----- 
						* `scaling_configuration_type` - The type of scaling configuration. 
						* `threshold` - A metric value at which the scaling operation will be triggered.

						* `instance_count_adjustment` - The value is used for adjusting the count of instances by. 
						* `pending_duration` - The period of time that the condition defined in the alarm must persist before the alarm state changes from "OK" to "FIRING" or vice versa. For example, a value of 5 minutes means that the alarm must persist in breaching the condition for five minutes before the alarm updates its state to "FIRING"; likewise, the alarm must persist in not breaching the condition for five minutes before the alarm updates its state to "OK."

							The duration is specified as a string in ISO 8601 format (`PT10M` for ten minutes or `PT1H` for one hour). Minimum: PT3M. Maximum: PT1H. Default: PT3M.

							----- 
						* `scaling_configuration_type` - The type of scaling configuration. 
						* `threshold` - A metric value at which the scaling operation will be triggered. 
			* `cool_down_in_seconds` - For threshold-based autoscaling policies, this value is the minimum period of time to wait between scaling actions. The cooldown period gives the system time to stabilize before rescaling. The minimum value is 600 seconds, which is also the default. The cooldown period starts when the model deployment becomes ACTIVE after the scaling operation. 
			* `instance_count` - The number of instances for the model deployment.
			* `is_enabled` - Whether the autoscaling policy is enabled.
			* `policy_type` - The type of scaling policy.

* `state` - The state of the model deployment.
* `time_created` - The date and time the resource was created, in the timestamp format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). Example: 2019-08-25T21:10:29.41Z
