# Data Source: oci_os_management_hub_software_sources
This data source provides the list of Software Sources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Os Management Hub service.

Lists software sources that match the specified tenancy or software source [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm). Filter the list against a
variety of criteria including but not limited to its name, status, architecture, and OS family.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_os_management_hub_software_sources" "test_software_sources" {

	#Optional
	arch_type = var.software_source_arch_type
	availability = var.software_source_availability
	availability_anywhere = var.software_source_availability_anywhere
	availability_at_oci = var.software_source_availability_at_oci
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.software_source_display_name
	display_name_contains = var.software_source_display_name_contains
	display_name_not_equal_to = var.software_source_display_name_not_equal_to
	is_mandatory_for_autonomous_linux = var.software_source_is_mandatory_for_autonomous_linux
	is_mirror_sync_allowed = var.software_source_is_mirror_sync_allowed
	os_family = var.software_source_os_family
	software_source_id = oci_os_management_hub_software_source.test_software_source.id
	software_source_type = var.software_source_software_source_type
	state = var.software_source_state
	vendor_name = var.software_source_vendor_name
}
```
