# Data Source: oci_ai_language_endpoints
This data source provides the list of Endpoints in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ai Language service.

Returns a list of Endpoints.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_ai_language_endpoints" "test_endpoints" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.endpoint_display_name
	endpoint_id = oci_ai_language_endpoint.test_endpoint.id
	model_id = oci_ai_language_model.test_model.id
	project_id = oci_ai_language_project.test_project.id
	state = var.endpoint_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `endpoint_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the endpoint.
* `model_id` - (Optional) The ID of the trained model for which to list the endpoints.
* `project_id` - (Optional) The ID of the project for which to list the objects.
* `state` - (Optional) <b>Filter</b> results by the specified lifecycle state. Must be a valid state for the resource type. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `endpoint_collection` - The list of endpoint_collection.

### Endpoint Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `alias` - Unique name across user tenancy in a region to identify an endpoint to be used for inferencing.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the endpoint compartment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - A short description of the endpoint.
* `display_name` - A user-friendly display name for the resource. It should be unique and can be modified. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - Unique identifier endpoint OCID of an endpoint that is immutable on creation.
* `inference_units` - Number of replicas required for this endpoint.
* `lifecycle_details` - A message describing the current state in more detail. For example, can be used to provide actionable information for a resource in failed state.
* `model_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the model to associate with the endpoint.
* `project_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the project to associate with the Endpoint.
* `state` - The state of the endpoint.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - The time the the endpoint was created. An RFC3339 formatted datetime string.
* `time_updated` - The time the endpoint was updated. An RFC3339 formatted datetime string.
