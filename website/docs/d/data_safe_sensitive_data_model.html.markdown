# Data Source: oci_data_safe_sensitive_data_model
This data source provides details about a specific Sensitive Data Model resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Gets the details of the specified sensitive data model.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_data_safe_sensitive_data_model" "test_sensitive_data_model" {
	#Required
	sensitive_data_model_id = oci_data_safe_sensitive_data_model.test_sensitive_data_model.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `sensitive_data_model_id` - (Required) The OCID of the sensitive data model.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `app_suite_name` - The application suite name identifying a collection of applications. The default value is GENERIC. It's useful only if maintaining a sensitive data model for a suite of applications. 
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the sensitive data model.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - The description of the sensitive data model.
* `display_name` - The display name of the sensitive data model.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm)  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the sensitive data model.
* `is_app_defined_relation_discovery_enabled` - Indicates if data discovery jobs should identify potential application-level (non-dictionary) referential relationships between columns. Note that data discovery automatically identifies and adds database-level (dictionary-defined) relationships. This option helps identify application-level relationships that are not defined in the database dictionary, which in turn, helps identify additional sensitive columns and preserve referential integrity during data masking. It's disabled by default and should be used only if there is a need to identify application-level relationships. 
* `is_include_all_schemas` - Indicates if all the schemas in the associated target database should be scanned by data discovery jobs. If it is set to true, sensitive data is discovered in all schemas (except for schemas maintained by Oracle). 
* `is_include_all_sensitive_types` - Indicates if all the existing sensitive types should be used by data discovery jobs.If it's set to true, the sensitiveTypeIdsForDiscovery attribute is ignored and all sensitive types are used for data discovery. 
* `is_sample_data_collection_enabled` - Indicates if data discovery jobs should collect and store sample data values for the discovered columns. Sample data helps review the discovered columns and ensure that they actually contain sensitive data. As it collects original data from the target database, it's disabled by default and should be used only if it's acceptable to store sample data in Data Safe's repository in Oracle Cloud. Note that sample data values are not collected for columns with the following data types: LONG, LOB, RAW, XMLTYPE and BFILE. 
* `schemas_for_discovery` - The schemas to be scanned by data discovery jobs.
* `sensitive_type_group_ids_for_discovery` - The OCIDs of the sensitive type groups to be used by data discovery jobs. 
* `sensitive_type_ids_for_discovery` - The OCIDs of the sensitive types to be used by data discovery jobs.
* `state` - The current state of the sensitive data model.
* `system_tags` - System tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `tables_for_discovery` - The data discovery jobs will scan the tables specified here, including both schemas and tables. For instance, the input could be in the format: [{schemaName: "HR", tableName: ["T1", "T2"]}, {schemaName:  "OE", tableName : ["T3", "T4"]}]. 
	* `schema_name` - This contains the name of the schema.
	* `table_names` - This contains an optional list of the table names.
* `target_id` - The OCID of the reference target database associated with the sensitive data model. All operations such as performing data discovery and adding columns manually are done in the context of the associated target database. 
* `time_created` - The date and time the sensitive data model was created, in the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
* `time_updated` - The date and time the sensitive data model was last updated, in the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
