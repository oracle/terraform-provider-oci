# Data Source: oci_data_safe_security_policy_deployments
This data source provides the list of Security Policy Deployments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Retrieves a list of all security policy deployments in Data Safe.

The ListSecurityPolicyDeployments operation returns only the security policy deployments in the specified `compartmentId`.

The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
`compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.

The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListSecurityPolicyDeployments on the
`compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_data_safe_security_policy_deployments" "test_security_policy_deployments" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	access_level = var.security_policy_deployment_access_level
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.security_policy_deployment_compartment_id_in_subtree
	display_name = var.security_policy_deployment_display_name
	security_policy_deployment_id = oci_data_safe_security_policy_deployment.test_security_policy_deployment.id
	security_policy_id = oci_data_safe_security_policy.test_security_policy.id
	state = var.security_policy_deployment_state
	target_id = oci_cloud_guard_target.test_target.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `access_level` - (Optional) Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED. Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) A filter to return only resources that match the specified compartment OCID.
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned. Depends on the 'accessLevel' setting. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the specified display name. 
* `security_policy_deployment_id` - (Optional) An optional filter to return only resources that match the specified OCID of the security policy deployment resource.
* `security_policy_id` - (Optional) An optional filter to return only resources that match the specified OCID of the security policy resource.
* `state` - (Optional) The current state of the security policy deployment.
* `target_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only items related to a specific target OCID.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `security_policy_deployment_collection` - The list of security_policy_deployment_collection.

### SecurityPolicyDeployment Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment containing the security policy deployment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - The description of the security policy deployment.
* `display_name` - The display name of the security policy deployment.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm)  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the security policy deployment.
* `lifecycle_details` - Details about the current state of the security policy deployment in Data Safe.
* `security_policy_id` - The OCID of the security policy corresponding to the security policy deployment.
* `state` - The current state of the security policy deployment.
* `system_tags` - System tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `target_id` - The OCID of the target where the security policy is deployed.
* `time_created` - The time that the security policy deployment was created, in the format defined by RFC3339.
* `time_updated` - The last date and time the security policy deployment was updated, in the format defined by RFC3339.
