data "oci_database_management_managed_my_sql_database_sql_data" "test_managed_my_sql_database_sql_data" {
	#Required
	end_time = var.managed_my_sql_database_sql_data_end_time
	managed_my_sql_database_id = oci_database_management_managed_my_sql_database.test_managed_my_sql_database.id
	start_time = var.managed_my_sql_database_sql_data_start_time

	#Optional
	filter_column = var.managed_my_sql_database_sql_data_filter_column
