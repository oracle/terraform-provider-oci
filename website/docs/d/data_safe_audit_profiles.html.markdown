# Data Source: oci_data_safe_audit_profiles
This data source provides the list of Audit Profiles in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Gets a list of all audit profiles.

The ListAuditProfiles operation returns only the audit profiles in the specified `compartmentId`.
The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.

The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
`compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.

The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListAuditProfiles on the
`compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_data_safe_audit_profiles" "test_audit_profiles" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	access_level = var.audit_profile_access_level
	audit_collected_volume_greater_than_or_equal_to = var.audit_profile_audit_collected_volume_greater_than_or_equal_to
	audit_profile_id = oci_data_safe_audit_profile.test_audit_profile.id
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.audit_profile_compartment_id_in_subtree
	display_name = var.audit_profile_display_name
	is_override_global_retention_setting = var.audit_profile_is_override_global_retention_setting
	is_paid_usage_enabled = var.audit_profile_is_paid_usage_enabled
	state = var.audit_profile_state
	target_id = oci_cloud_guard_target.test_target.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `access_level` - (Optional) Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED. Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed. 
* `audit_collected_volume_greater_than_or_equal_to` - (Optional) A filter to return only items that have count of audit records collected greater than or equal to the specified value.
* `audit_profile_id` - (Optional) A optional filter to return only resources that match the specified id.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) A filter to return only resources that match the specified compartment OCID.
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned. Depends on the 'accessLevel' setting. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the specified display name. 
* `is_override_global_retention_setting` - (Optional) A optional filter to return only resources that match the specified retention configured value.
* `is_paid_usage_enabled` - (Optional) Indicates if you want to continue audit record collection beyond the free limit of one million audit records per month per target database, incurring additional charges. The default value is inherited from the global settings. You can change at the global level or at the target level. 
* `state` - (Optional) A optional filter to return only resources that match the specified lifecycle state.
* `target_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only items related to a specific target OCID.
