# Data Source: oci_database_exadb_vm_cluster
This data source provides details about a specific Exadb Vm Cluster resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets information about the specified Exadata VM cluster on Exascale Infrastructure. Applies to Exadata Database Service on Exascale Infrastructure only.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_exadb_vm_cluster" "test_exadb_vm_cluster" {
	#Required
	exadb_vm_cluster_id = oci_database_exadb_vm_cluster.test_exadb_vm_cluster.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `exadb_vm_cluster_id` - (Required) The Exadata VM cluster [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) on Exascale Infrastructure.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `availability_domain` - The name of the availability domain in which the Exadata VM cluster on Exascale Infrastructure is located. 
* `backup_network_nsg_ids` - A list of the [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network security groups (NSGs) that the backup network of this DB system belongs to. Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see [Security Rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm). Applicable only to Exadata systems. 
* `backup_subnet_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup network subnet associated with the Exadata VM cluster on Exascale Infrastructure. 
* `cluster_name` - The cluster name for Exadata VM cluster on Exascale Infrastructure. The cluster name must begin with an alphabetic character, and may contain hyphens (-). Underscores (_) are not permitted. The cluster name can be no longer than 11 characters and is not case sensitive. 
* `cluster_placement_group_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the cluster placement group of the Exadata Infrastructure.

* `data_collection_options` - Indicates user preferences for the various diagnostic collection options for the VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster/VMBM DBCS. 
	* `is_diagnostics_events_enabled` - Indicates whether diagnostic collection is enabled for the VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster/VMBM DBCS. Enabling diagnostic collection allows you to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues. Diagnostic collection also allows Oracle to provide enhanced service and proactive support for your Exadata system. You can enable diagnostic collection during VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster provisioning. You can also disable or enable it at any time using the `UpdateVmCluster` or `updateCloudVmCluster` API. 
	* `is_health_monitoring_enabled` - Indicates whether health monitoring is enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling health monitoring allows Oracle to collect diagnostic data and share it with its operations and support personnel. You may also receive notifications for some events. Collecting health diagnostics enables Oracle to provide proactive support and enhanced service for your system. Optionally enable health monitoring while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable health monitoring anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `UpdateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
	* `is_incident_logs_enabled` - Indicates whether incident logs and trace collection are enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling incident logs collection allows Oracle to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues, collect incident logs and traces, and use them to diagnose issues and resolve them. Optionally enable incident logs collection while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable incident logs collection anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `updateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API.
