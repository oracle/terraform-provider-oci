# Data Source: oci_core_instance
This data source provides details about a specific Instance resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Gets information about the specified instance.

**Note:** To retrieve public and private IP addresses for an instance, use the [ListVnicAttachments](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/VnicAttachment/ListVnicAttachments)
operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call [GetVnic](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vnic/GetVnic) with the VNIC ID.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_instance" "test_instance" {
	#Required
	instance_id = oci_core_instance.test_instance.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `instance_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the instance.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `agent_config` - Configuration options for the Oracle Cloud Agent software running on the instance.
	* `are_all_plugins_disabled` - Whether Oracle Cloud Agent can run all of the available plugins. This includes the management and monitoring plugins.

		For more information about the available plugins, see [Managing Plugins with Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm). 
	* `is_management_disabled` - Whether Oracle Cloud Agent can run all the available management plugins.

		These are the management plugins: OS Management Service Agent and Compute Instance Run Command.

		The management plugins are controlled by this parameter and by the per-plugin configuration in the `pluginsConfig` object.
		* If `isManagementDisabled` is true, all of the management plugins are disabled, regardless of the per-plugin configuration.
		* If `isManagementDisabled` is false, all of the management plugins are enabled. You can optionally disable individual management plugins by providing a value in the `pluginsConfig` object. 
	* `is_monitoring_disabled` - Whether Oracle Cloud Agent can gather performance metrics and monitor the instance using the monitoring plugins.

		These are the monitoring plugins: Compute Instance Monitoring and Custom Logs Monitoring.

		The monitoring plugins are controlled by this parameter and by the per-plugin configuration in the `pluginsConfig` object.
		* If `isMonitoringDisabled` is true, all of the monitoring plugins are disabled, regardless of the per-plugin configuration.
		* If `isMonitoringDisabled` is false, all of the monitoring plugins are enabled. You can optionally disable individual monitoring plugins by providing a value in the `pluginsConfig` object. 
	* `plugins_config` - The configuration of plugins associated with this instance.
		* `desired_state` - Whether the plugin should be enabled or disabled.

			To enable the monitoring and management plugins, the `isMonitoringDisabled` and `isManagementDisabled` attributes must also be set to false. 
		* `name` - The plugin name. To get a list of available plugins, use the [ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/instanceagent/20180530/Plugin/ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins) operation in the Oracle Cloud Agent API. For more information about the available plugins, see [Managing Plugins with Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm). 
* `availability_config` - Options for defining the availabiity of a VM instance after a maintenance event that impacts the underlying hardware. 
	* `is_live_migration_preferred` - Whether to live migrate supported VM instances to a healthy physical VM host without disrupting running instances during infrastructure maintenance events. If null, Oracle chooses the best option for migrating the VM during infrastructure maintenance events. 
	* `recovery_action` - The lifecycle state for an instance when it is recovered after infrastructure maintenance.
		* `RESTORE_INSTANCE` - The instance is restored to the lifecycle state it was in before the maintenance event. If the instance was running, it is automatically rebooted. This is the default action when a value is not set.
		* `STOP_INSTANCE` - The instance is recovered in the stopped state. 
* `availability_domain` - The availability domain the instance is running in.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `cluster_placement_group_id` - The OCID of the cluster placement group of the instance.
* `boot_volume_id` - The OCID of the attached boot volume. If the `source_type` is `bootVolume`, this will be the same OCID as the `source_id`.
* `capacity_reservation_id` - The OCID of the compute capacity reservation this instance is launched under. When this field contains an empty string or is null, the instance is not currently in a capacity reservation. For more information, see [Capacity Reservations](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/reserve-capacity.htm#default).
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the instance.
* `dedicated_vm_host_id` - The OCID of the dedicated virtual machine host that the instance is placed on. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `extended_metadata` - Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide. They serve the same purpose and functionality as fields in the `metadata` object.

	They are distinguished from `metadata` fields in that these can be nested JSON objects (whereas `metadata` fields are string/string maps only). 

	If you don't need nested metadata values, it is strongly advised to avoid using this object and use the Metadata object instead.

	Input in terraform is the same as metadata but allows nested metadata if you pass a valid JSON string as a value. See the example below.
* `fault_domain` - The name of the fault domain the instance is running in.

	A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.

	If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for you.

	Example: `FAULT-DOMAIN-1` 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `hostname_label` - The hostname for the instance VNIC's primary private IP. 
* `id` - The OCID of the instance.
* `image` - Deprecated. Use `sourceDetails` instead. 
* `instance_configuration_id` - The OCID of the Instance Configuration used to source launch details for this instance. Any other fields supplied in the instance launch request override the details stored in the Instance Configuration for this instance launch.
* `instance_options` - Optional mutable instance options
	* `are_legacy_imds_endpoints_disabled` - Whether to disable the legacy (/v1) instance metadata service endpoints. Customers who have migrated to /v2 should set this to true for added security. Default is false. 
* `ipxe_script` - When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.

	If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots. Be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots, not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.

	The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

	If your instance boot volume attachment type is paravirtualized, the boot volume is attached to the instance through virtio-scsi and no iPXE script is used. If your instance boot volume attachment type is paravirtualized and you use custom iPXE to network boot into your instance, the primary boot volume is attached as a data volume through virtio-scsi drive.

	For more information about the Bring Your Own Image feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see [Bring Your Own Image](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm).

	For more information about iPXE, see http://ipxe.org.
