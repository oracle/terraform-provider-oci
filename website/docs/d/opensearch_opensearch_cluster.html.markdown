# Data Source: oci_opensearch_opensearch_cluster
This data source provides details about a specific Opensearch Cluster resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Opensearch service.

Gets a OpensearchCluster by identifier

## Prerequisites
The below policies must be created in compartment before creating OpensearchCluster

##### {Compartment-Name} - Name of  your compartment
```
Allow service opensearch to manage vnics in compartment {Compartment-Name}
Allow service opensearch to use subnets in compartment {Compartment-Name}
Allow service opensearch to use network-security-groups in compartment {Compartment-Name}
Allow service opensearch to manage vcns in compartment {Compartment-Name}
```

For latest documentation on OpenSearch use please refer to https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/search-opensearch/home.htm  
Required permissions: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/search-opensearch/Concepts/ocisearchpermissions.htm

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_opensearch_opensearch_cluster" "test_opensearch_cluster" {
	#Required
	opensearch_cluster_id = oci_opensearch_opensearch_cluster.test_opensearch_cluster.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `opensearch_cluster_id` - (Required) unique OpensearchCluster identifier


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `availability_domains` - The availability domains to distribute the cluser nodes across.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment where the cluster is located.
* `data_node_count` - The number of data nodes configured for the cluster.
* `data_node_host_bare_metal_shape` - The bare metal shape for the cluster's data nodes.

* `fqdn` - The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for the cluster's API endpoint.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}`
* `id` - The OCID of the cluster.
* `inbound_cluster_ids` - List of inbound clusters for which this cluster is an outbound cluster
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state of the cluster.
* `maintenance_details` - Details for the maintenance activity.
	* `end_time` - End time of the maintenance activity
