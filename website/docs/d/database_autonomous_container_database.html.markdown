# Data Source: oci_database_autonomous_container_database
This data source provides details about a specific Autonomous Container Database resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets information about the specified Autonomous Container Database.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_autonomous_container_database" "test_autonomous_container_database" {
	#Required
	autonomous_container_database_id = oci_database_autonomous_container_database.test_autonomous_container_database.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `autonomous_container_database_id` - (Required) The Autonomous Container Database [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `autonomous_exadata_infrastructure_id` - The OCID of the Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure.
* `autonomous_vm_cluster_id` - The OCID of the Autonomous VM Cluster.
* `availability_domain` - The availability domain of the Autonomous Container Database.
* `backup_config` - Backup options for the Autonomous Container Database. 
	* `backup_destination_details` - Backup destination details.
		* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup destination.
		* `internet_proxy` - Proxy URL to connect to object store.
		* `type` - Type of the database backup destination.
		* `vpc_password` - For a RECOVERY_APPLIANCE backup destination, the password for the VPC user that is used to access the Recovery Appliance.
		* `vpc_user` - For a RECOVERY_APPLIANCE backup destination, the Virtual Private Catalog (VPC) user that is used to access the Recovery Appliance.
	* `recovery_window_in_days` - Number of days between the current and the earliest point of recoverability covered by automatic backups. This value applies to automatic backups. After a new automatic backup has been created, Oracle removes old automatic backups that are created before the window. When the value is updated, it is applied to all existing automatic backups.

* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment.
* `db_unique_name` - **Deprecated.** The `DB_UNIQUE_NAME` value is set by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.  Do not specify a value for this parameter. Specifying a value for this field will cause Terraform operations to fail. 
* `db_version` - Oracle Database version of the Autonomous Container Database.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `display_name` - The user-provided name for the Autonomous Container Database.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the Autonomous Container Database.
* `infrastructure_type` - The infrastructure type this resource belongs to.
* `key_history_entry` - Key History Entry.
	* `id` - The id of the Autonomous Database [Vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm#concepts) service key management history entry.
	* `kms_key_version_id` - The OCID of the key container version that is used in database transparent data encryption (TDE) operations KMS Key can have multiple key versions. If none is specified, the current key version (latest) of the Key Id is used for the operation. 
	* `time_activated` - The date and time the kms key activated.
	* `vault_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm#concepts).
* `key_store_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the key store.
* `key_store_wallet_name` - The wallet name for Oracle Key Vault.
* `kms_key_id` - The OCID of the key container that is used as the master encryption key in database transparent data encryption (TDE) operations.
* `kms_key_version_id` - The OCID of the key container version that is used in database transparent data encryption (TDE) operations KMS Key can have multiple key versions. If none is specified, the current key version (latest) of the Key Id is used for the operation. 
* `last_maintenance_run_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last maintenance run.
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `maintenance_window` - The scheduling details for the quarterly maintenance window. Patching and system updates take place during the maintenance window. 
	* `days_of_week` - Days during the week when maintenance should be performed.
		* `name` - Name of the day of the week.
	* `hours_of_day` - The window of hours during the day when maintenance should be performed. The window is a 4 hour slot. Valid values are
		* 0 - represents time slot 0:00 - 3:59 UTC - 4 - represents time slot 4:00 - 7:59 UTC - 8 - represents time slot 8:00 - 11:59 UTC - 12 - represents time slot 12:00 - 15:59 UTC - 16 - represents time slot 16:00 - 19:59 UTC - 20 - represents time slot 20:00 - 23:59 UTC
	* `lead_time_in_weeks` - Lead time window allows user to set a lead time to prepare for a down time. The lead time is in weeks and valid value is between 1 to 4.
