# Data Source: oci_data_safe_alerts
This data source provides the list of Alerts in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Gets a list of all alerts.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_data_safe_alerts" "test_alerts" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	access_level = var.alert_access_level
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.alert_compartment_id_in_subtree
	field = var.alert_field
	id = var.alert_id
	scim_query = var.alert_scim_query
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `access_level` - (Optional) Valid values are RESTRICTED and ACCESSIBLE. Default is RESTRICTED. Setting this to ACCESSIBLE returns only those compartments for which the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to RESTRICTED permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) A filter to return only resources that match the specified compartment OCID.
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned. Depends on the 'accessLevel' setting.
* `field` - (Optional) Specifies a subset of fields to be returned in the response.
* `id` - (Optional) A filter to return alert by it's OCID.
* `scim_query` - (Optional) The scimQuery query parameter accepts filter expressions that use the syntax described in Section 3.2.2.2 of the System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM) specification, which is available at [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-scim-api-12). In SCIM filtering expressions, text, date, and time values must be enclosed in quotation marks, with date and time values using ISO-8601 format. (Numeric and boolean values should not be quoted.)

  **Example:** | query=(timeCreated ge '2021-06-04T01-00-26') and (targetNames eq 'target_1') query=(featureDetails.userName eq "user") and (targetNames eq "target_1") Supported fields: severity status alertType targetIds targetNames operationTime lifecycleState displayName timeCreated timeUpdated featureDetails.* (* can be any field in nestedStrMap in Feature Attributes in Alert Summary. For example -  userName,object,clientHostname,osUserName,clientIPs,clientId,commandText,commandParam,clientProgram,objectType,targetOwner)
