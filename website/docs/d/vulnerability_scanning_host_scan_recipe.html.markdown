# Data Source: oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_recipe
This data source provides details about a specific Host Scan Recipe resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service.

Retrieves a HostScanRecipe identified by the recipe ID. A recipe determines the types of security issues that you want scanned, and how often to scan.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_recipe" "test_host_scan_recipe" {
	#Required
	host_scan_recipe_id = oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_recipe.test_host_scan_recipe.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `host_scan_recipe_id` - (Required) unique HostScanRecipe identifier


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `agent_settings` - Agent scan settings for a host scan
	* `agent_configuration` - Agent configuration for host scan agent settings. This model is polymorphic, presenting different configuration options based on selected agent vendor.
		* `cis_benchmark_settings` - CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmark scan settings for a host scan
			* `scan_level` - The level of strictness to apply for CIS Benchmarks. Use 'NONE' to disable CIS Benchmark checks entirely.
		* `endpoint_protection_settings` - Endpoint Protection scan settings for a host scan
			* `scan_level` - The scan level. Use 'NONE' to disable Endpoint Protection checks entirely.
		* `vendor` - Vendor to use for the host scan agent.
	* `scan_level` - The scan level
* `compartment_id` - Compartment ID of the scan recipe
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - Recipe identifier, which can be renamed
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - Unique identifier of the config that is immutable on creation
* `port_settings` - Port scan settings for a host scan
	* `scan_level` - The scan level
* `schedule` - A scanning schedule
	* `day_of_week` - Day of week the scheduled scan occurs (not applicable for DAILY type)
	* `type` - How often the scan occurs
* `state` - The current state of the config.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - Date and time the recipe was created, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
* `time_updated` - Date and time the recipe was last updated, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
