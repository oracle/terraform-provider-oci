# Data Source: oci_golden_gate_deployments
This data source provides the list of Deployments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Golden Gate service.

Lists the Deployments in a compartment.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_golden_gate_deployments" "test_deployments" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	assignable_connection_id = oci_golden_gate_connection.test_connection.id
	assigned_connection_id = oci_golden_gate_connection.test_connection.id
	display_name = var.deployment_display_name
	fqdn = var.deployment_fqdn
	lifecycle_sub_state = var.deployment_lifecycle_sub_state
	state = var.deployment_state
	supported_connection_type = var.deployment_supported_connection_type
}
```

## Argument Reference
