* `lifecycle_stage_ids` - The lifecycle stage [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) that this scheduled job operates on.  A scheduled job can only operate on one type of target, therefore this parameter is mutually exclusive with  managedInstanceIds, managedInstanceGroupIds, and managedCompartmentIds. 
* `locations` - The list of locations this scheduled job should operate on for a job targeting on compartments. (Empty list means apply to all locations). This can only be set when managedCompartmentIds is not empty.
* `managed_compartment_ids` - The compartment [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) that this scheduled job operates on.

If that fails, the service waits 5 minutes  and then retries. If that fails, the service waits 10 minutes and then retries.
