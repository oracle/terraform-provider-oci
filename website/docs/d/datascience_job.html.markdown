# Data Source: oci_datascience_job
This data source provides details about a specific Job resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science service.

Gets a job.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_datascience_job" "test_job" {
	#Required
	job_id = oci_datascience_job.test_job.id
}
```

## Argument Reference
