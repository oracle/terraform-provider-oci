This data source provides the list of Autonomous Vm Clusters in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets a list of Exadata Cloud@Customer Autonomous VM clusters in the specified compartment. To list Autonomous VM Clusters in the Oracle Cloud, see [ListCloudAutonomousVmClusters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/database/latest/CloudAutonomousVmCluster/ListCloudAutonomousVmClusters).


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_autonomous_vm_clusters" "test_autonomous_vm_clusters" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.autonomous_vm_cluster_display_name
	exadata_infrastructure_id = oci_database_exadata_infrastructure.test_exadata_infrastructure.id
	state = var.autonomous_vm_cluster_state
}
```

* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Autonomous VM cluster.
* `is_local_backup_enabled` - If true, database backup on local Exadata storage is configured for the Autonomous VM cluster. If false, database backup on local Exadata storage is not available in the Autonomous VM cluster. 
* `is_mtls_enabled` - Enable mutual TLS(mTLS) authentication for database while provisioning a VMCluster. Default is TLS.
* `last_maintenance_run_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last maintenance run.
* `license_model` - The Oracle license model that applies to the Autonomous VM cluster. The default is LICENSE_INCLUDED. 
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `maintenance_window` - The scheduling details for the quarterly maintenance window. Patching and system updates take place during the maintenance window. 
	* `days_of_week` - Days during the week when maintenance should be performed.
		* `name` - Name of the day of the week.
	* `hours_of_day` - The window of hours during the day when maintenance should be performed. The window is a 4 hour slot. Valid values are
		* 0 - represents time slot 0:00 - 3:59 UTC - 4 - represents time slot 4:00 - 7:59 UTC - 8 - represents time slot 8:00 - 11:59 UTC - 12 - represents time slot 12:00 - 15:59 UTC - 16 - represents time slot 16:00 - 19:59 UTC - 20 - represents time slot 20:00 - 23:59 UTC

Weeks start and end based on calendar dates, not days of the week. For example, to allow maintenance during the 2nd week of the month (from the 8th day to the 14th day of the month), use the value 2. Maintenance cannot be scheduled for the fifth week of months that contain more than 28 days. Note that this parameter works in conjunction with the  daysOfWeek and hoursOfDay parameters to allow you to specify specific days of the week and hours that maintenance will be performed.

	* These are the CPUs that continue to be included in the count of CPUs available to the Autonomous Container Database even after one of its Autonomous Database is terminated or scaled down. You can release them to the available CPUs at its parent Autonomous VM Cluster level by restarting the Autonomous Container Database.
	* The CPU type (OCPUs or ECPUs) is determined by the parent Autonomous Exadata VM Cluster's compute model.
* `scan_listener_port_non_tls` - The SCAN Listener Non TLS port number. Default value is 1521.
* `scan_listener_port_tls` - The SCAN Listener TLS port number. Default value is 2484.
