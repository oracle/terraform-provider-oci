# Data Source: oci_waas_custom_protection_rule
This data source provides details about a specific Custom Protection Rule resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Waas service.

Gets the details of a custom protection rule.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_waas_custom_protection_rule" "test_custom_protection_rule" {
	#Required
	custom_protection_rule_id = "${oci_waas_custom_protection_rule.test_custom_protection_rule.id}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `custom_protection_rule_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the custom protection rule. This number is generated when the custom protection rule is added to the compartment.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the custom protection rule's compartment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - The description of the custom protection rule.
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name of the custom protection rule.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the custom protection rule.
* `mod_security_rule_ids` - The auto-generated ID for the custom protection rule. These IDs are referenced in logs.
* `state` - The current lifecycle state of the custom protection rule.
* `template` - The template text of the custom protection rule. All custom protection rules are expressed in ModSecurity Rule Language.

	Additionally, each rule must include two placeholder variables that are updated by the WAF service upon publication of the rule.

	`id: {{id_1}}` - This field is populated with a unique rule ID generated by the WAF service which identifies a `SecRule`. More than one `SecRule` can be defined in the `template` field of a CreateCustomSecurityRule call. The value of the first `SecRule` must be `id: {{id_1}}` and the `id` field of each subsequent `SecRule` should increase by one, as shown in the example.

	`ctl:ruleEngine={{mode}}` - The action to be taken when the criteria of the `SecRule` are met, either `OFF`, `DETECT` or `BLOCK`. This field is automatically populated with the corresponding value of the `action` field of the `CustomProtectionRuleSetting` schema when the `WafConfig` is updated.

	*Example:* ``` SecRule REQUEST_COOKIES "regex matching SQL injection - part 1/2" \ "phase:2,                                                 \ msg:'Detects chained SQL injection attempts 1/2.',        \ id: {{id_1}},                                             \ ctl:ruleEngine={{mode}},                                  \ deny" SecRule REQUEST_COOKIES "regex matching SQL injection - part 2/2" \ "phase:2,                                                 \ msg:'Detects chained SQL injection attempts 2/2.',        \ id: {{id_2}},                                             \ ctl:ruleEngine={{mode}},                                  \ deny" ```

	 The example contains two `SecRules` each having distinct regex expression to match the `Cookie` header value during the second input analysis phase.
