# Data Source: oci_database_databases
This data source provides the list of Databases in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets a list of the databases in the specified Database Home.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_databases" "test_databases" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	db_home_id = oci_database_db_home.test_db_home.id
	db_name = var.database_db_name
	state = var.database_state
	system_id = oci_database_system.test_system.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The compartment [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `db_home_id` - (Optional) A Database Home [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm). *Note: Either `db_home_id` or `system_id` is required to make the LIST API call.
* `db_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire database name given. The match is not case sensitive.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given lifecycle state exactly.
* `system_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Exadata DB system that you want to filter the database results by. Applies only to Exadata DB systems.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `databases` - The list of databases.

### Database Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `character_set` - The character set for the database.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `connection_strings` - The Connection strings used to connect to the Oracle Database.
	* `all_connection_strings` - All connection strings to use to connect to the Database.
	* `cdb_default` - Host name based CDB Connection String.
	* `cdb_ip_default` - IP based CDB Connection String.
* `database_management_config` - The configuration of the Database Management service.
	* `management_status` - The status of the Database Management service.
	* `management_type` - The Database Management type.
* `database_software_image_id` - The database software image [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)
* `db_backup_config` - Backup Options To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm). 
	* `auto_backup_enabled` - If set to true, configures automatic backups. If you previously used RMAN or dbcli to configure backups and then you switch to using the Console or the API for backups, a new backup configuration is created and associated with your database. This means that you can no longer rely on your previously configured unmanaged backups to work.
	* `auto_backup_window` - Time window selected for initiating automatic backup for the database system. There are twelve available two-hour time windows. If no option is selected, a start time between 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the region of the database is automatically chosen. For example, if the user selects SLOT_TWO from the enum list, the automatic backup job will start in between 2:00 AM (inclusive) to 4:00 AM (exclusive).  Example: `SLOT_TWO` 
	* `auto_full_backup_day` - Day of the week the full backup should be applied on the database system. If no option is selected, the value is null and we will default to Sunday.
	* `auto_full_backup_window` - Time window selected for initiating full backup for the database system. There are twelve available two-hour time windows. If no option is selected, the value is null and a start time between 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the region of the database is automatically chosen. For example, if the user selects SLOT_TWO from the enum list, the automatic backup job will start in between 2:00 AM (inclusive) to 4:00 AM (exclusive).  Example: `SLOT_TWO` 
	* `backup_deletion_policy` - This defines when the backups will be deleted. - IMMEDIATE option keep the backup for predefined time i.e 72 hours and then delete permanently... - RETAIN will keep the backups as per the policy defined for database backups.
	* `backup_destination_details` - Backup destination details.
		* `dbrs_policy_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DBRS policy used for backup.
		* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup destination.
		* `type` - Type of the database backup destination.
	* `recovery_window_in_days` - Number of days between the current and the earliest point of recoverability covered by automatic backups. This value applies to automatic backups only. After a new automatic backup has been created, Oracle removes old automatic backups that are created before the window. When the value is updated, it is applied to all existing automatic backups. 
	* `run_immediate_full_backup` - If set to true, configures automatic full backups in the local region (the region of the DB system) for the first backup run immediately.
* `db_home_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Database Home.
* `db_name` - The database name.
* `db_system_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DB system.
* `db_unique_name` - A system-generated name for the database to ensure uniqueness within an Oracle Data Guard group (a primary database and its standby databases). The unique name cannot be changed. 
* `db_workload` - **Deprecated.** The dbWorkload field has been deprecated for Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure, Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer, and Base Database Service. Support for this attribute will end in November 2023. You may choose to update your custom scripts to exclude the dbWorkload attribute. After November 2023 if you pass a value to the dbWorkload attribute, it will be ignored.

	The database workload type. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the database.

If none is specified, the current key version (latest) of the Key Id is used for the operation. Autonomous Database Serverless does not use key versions, hence is not applicable for Autonomous Database Serverless instances. 
* `last_backup_duration_in_seconds` - The duration when the latest database backup created.
* `last_backup_timestamp` - The date and time when the latest database backup was created.
* `last_failed_backup_timestamp` - The date and time when the latest database backup failed.

* `pdb_name` - The name of the pluggable database. The name must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of thirty alphanumeric characters. Special characters are not permitted. Pluggable database should not be same as database name.
* `sid_prefix` - Specifies a prefix for the `Oracle SID` of the database to be created. 
* `source_database_point_in_time_recovery_timestamp` - Point in time recovery timeStamp of the source database at which cloned database system is cloned from the source database system, as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
* `state` - The current state of the database.
* `time_created` - The date and time the database was created.
* `vault_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm#concepts).
