# Data Source: oci_database_db_systems
This data source provides the list of Db Systems in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Lists the DB systems in the specified compartment. You can specify a `backupId` to list only the DB systems that support creating a database using this backup in this compartment.

**Note:** Deprecated for Exadata Cloud Service systems. Use the [new resource model APIs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/exaflexsystem.htm#exaflexsystem_topic-resource_model) instead.

For Exadata Cloud Service instances, support for this API will end on May 15th, 2021. See [Switching an Exadata DB System to the New Resource Model and APIs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/exaflexsystem_topic-resource_model_conversion.htm) for details on converting existing Exadata DB systems to the new resource model.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_db_systems" "test_db_systems" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	availability_domain = var.db_system_availability_domain
	backup_id = oci_database_backup.test_backup.id
	display_name = var.db_system_display_name
	state = var.db_system_state
}
```

Weeks start and end based on calendar dates, not days of the week. For example, to allow maintenance during the 2nd week of the month (from the 8th day to the 14th day of the month), use the value 2. Maintenance cannot be scheduled for the fifth week of months that contain more than 28 days. Note that this parameter works in conjunction with the  daysOfWeek and hoursOfDay parameters to allow you to specify specific days of the week and hours that maintenance will be performed. 
* `next_maintenance_run_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the next maintenance run.

Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see [Security Rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm). **NsgIds restrictions:**
	* Autonomous Databases with private access require at least 1 Network Security Group (NSG). The nsgIds array cannot be empty. 
* `point_in_time_data_disk_clone_timestamp` - The point in time for a cloned database system when the data disks were cloned from the source database system, as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339).

* `scan_dns_record_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DNS record for the SCAN IP addresses that are associated with the DB system. 
* `scan_ip_ids` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Single Client Access Name (SCAN) IP addresses associated with the DB system. SCAN IP addresses are typically used for load balancing and are not assigned to any interface. Oracle Clusterware directs the requests to the appropriate nodes in the cluster.

	**Note:** For a single-node DB system, this list is empty. 
* `shape` - The shape of the DB system. The shape determines resources to allocate to the DB system.
	* For virtual machine shapes, the number of CPU cores and memory
	* For bare metal and Exadata shapes, the number of CPU cores, storage, and memory

* `ssh_public_keys` - The public key portion of one or more key pairs used for SSH access to the DB system.
* `state` - The current state of the DB system.
* `subnet_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet the DB system is associated with.

	**Subnet Restrictions:**
	* For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28.
	* For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node RAC DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.

	These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and backup subnet. 
* `time_created` - The date and time the DB system was created.
* `time_zone` - The time zone of the DB system. For details, see [DB System Time Zones](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/References/timezones.htm).
* `version` - The Oracle Database version of the DB system.
* `vip_ids` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the virtual IP (VIP) addresses associated with the DB system. The Cluster Ready Services (CRS) creates and maintains one VIP address for each node in the DB system to enable failover. If one node fails, the VIP is reassigned to another active node in the cluster.

	**Note:** For a single-node DB system, this list is empty. 
* `zone_id` - The OCID of the zone the DB system is associated with.
