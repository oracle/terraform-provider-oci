# Data Source: oci_database_db_systems
This data source provides the list of Db Systems in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Lists the DB systems in the specified compartment. You can specify a `backupId` to list only the DB systems that support creating a database using this backup in this compartment.

**Note:** Deprecated for Exadata Cloud Service systems. Use the [new resource model APIs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/exaflexsystem.htm#exaflexsystem_topic-resource_model) instead.

For Exadata Cloud Service instances, support for this API will end on May 15th, 2021. See [Switching an Exadata DB System to the New Resource Model and APIs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/exaflexsystem_topic-resource_model_conversion.htm) for details on converting existing Exadata DB systems to the new resource model.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_db_systems" "test_db_systems" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	availability_domain = var.db_system_availability_domain
	backup_id = oci_database_backup.test_backup.id
	display_name = var.db_system_display_name
	state = var.db_system_state
}
```

* `availability_domain` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given availability domain exactly.
* `backup_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup. Specify a backupId to list only the DB systems or DB homes that support creating a database using this backup in this compartment.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The compartment [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `db_systems` - The list of db_systems.

### DbSystem Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `availability_domain` - The name of the availability domain that the DB system is located in.
* `backup_network_nsg_ids` - A list of the [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network security groups (NSGs) that the backup network of this DB system belongs to. Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see [Security Rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm). Applicable only to Exadata systems. 
* `backup_subnet_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup network subnet the DB system is associated with. Applicable only to Exadata DB systems.

	**Subnet Restriction:** See the subnet restrictions information for **subnetId**. 
* `cluster_name` - The cluster name for Exadata and 2-node RAC virtual machine DB systems. The cluster name must begin with an alphabetic character, and may contain hyphens (-). Underscores (_) are not permitted. The cluster name can be no longer than 11 characters and is not case sensitive. 
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `cpu_core_count` - The number of CPU cores enabled on the DB system.
* `data_collection_options` - Indicates user preferences for the various diagnostic collection options for the VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster/VMBM DBCS. 
	* `is_diagnostics_events_enabled` - Indicates whether diagnostic collection is enabled for the VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster/VMBM DBCS. Enabling diagnostic collection allows you to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues. Diagnostic collection also allows Oracle to provide enhanced service and proactive support for your Exadata system. You can enable diagnostic collection during VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster provisioning. You can also disable or enable it at any time using the `UpdateVmCluster` or `updateCloudVmCluster` API. 
	* `is_health_monitoring_enabled` - Indicates whether health monitoring is enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling health monitoring allows Oracle to collect diagnostic data and share it with its operations and support personnel. You may also receive notifications for some events. Collecting health diagnostics enables Oracle to provide proactive support and enhanced service for your system. Optionally enable health monitoring while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable health monitoring anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `UpdateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
	* `is_incident_logs_enabled` - Indicates whether incident logs and trace collection are enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling incident logs collection allows Oracle to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues, collect incident logs and traces, and use them to diagnose issues and resolve them. Optionally enable incident logs collection while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable incident logs collection anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `updateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
* `data_storage_percentage` - The percentage assigned to DATA storage (user data and database files). The remaining percentage is assigned to RECO storage (database redo logs, archive logs, and recovery manager backups). Accepted values are 40 and 80. The default is 80 percent assigned to DATA storage. Not applicable for virtual machine DB systems. Required for BMDBs.
