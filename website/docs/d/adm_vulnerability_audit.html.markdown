# Data Source: oci_adm_vulnerability_audit
This data source provides details about a specific Vulnerability Audit resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ADM service.

Returns the details of the specified Vulnerability Audit.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_adm_vulnerability_audit" "test_vulnerability_audit" {
	#Required
	vulnerability_audit_id = oci_adm_vulnerability_audit.test_vulnerability_audit.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vulnerability_audit_id` - (Required) Unique Vulnerability Audit identifier path parameter.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `build_type` - The type of the build tool.
* `compartment_id` - The compartment Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the vulnerability audit.
* `configuration` - Configuration for a vulnerability audit. A vulnerable application dependency is ignored if its name does match any of the items in `exclusions`, or all of the associated Vulnerabilies have a CVSS v2 score below `maxPermissibleCvssV2Score` and a CVSS v3 score below `maxPermissibleCvssV3Score`. type: object 
	* `exclusions` - A vulnerable application dependency is ignored if its name matches any of the items in `exclusions`. An asterisk (*) in the dependency pattern acts as a wildcard and matches zero or more characters. 
	* `max_permissible_cvss_v2score` - A vulnerable application dependency is ignored if the score of its associated Vulnerability is below maxPermissibleCvssV2Score and below maxPermissibleCvssV3Score.
	* `max_permissible_cvss_v3score` - A vulnerable application dependency is ignored if the score of its associated Vulnerability is below maxPermissibleCvssV2Score and below maxPermissibleCvssV3Score.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - The name of the vulnerability audit.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the vulnerability audit.
* `is_success` - Indicates if an audit succeeded according to the configuration. The value is `null` if the audit is in the `CREATING` state.
* `knowledge_base_id` - The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the knowledge base.
* `max_observed_cvss_v2score` - Maximum Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2 score observed for non-ignored vulnerable application dependencies.
* `max_observed_cvss_v2score_with_ignored` - Maximum Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2 score observed for vulnerable application dependencies including ignored ones.
* `max_observed_cvss_v3score` - Maximum Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3 score observed for non-ignored vulnerable application dependencies.
* `max_observed_cvss_v3score_with_ignored` - Maximum Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3 score observed for vulnerable application dependencies including ignored ones.
* `source` - vulnerability audit source.
	* `description` - Description of the external resource source.
	* `oci_resource_id` - The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource that triggered the vulnerability audit.
	* `type` - Source type of the vulnerability audit.
* `state` - The current lifecycle state of the vulnerability audit.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - The creation date and time of the vulnerability audit (formatted according to [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)).
* `time_updated` - The update date and time of the vulnerability audit (formatted according to [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)).
* `vulnerabilities` - List of vulnerabilities found in the vulnerability audit.
	* `cvss_v2score` - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 2.
	* `cvss_v3score` - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.
	* `id` - Unique vulnerability identifier, e.g. CVE-1999-0067.
	* `is_ignored` - Indicates if the vulnerability was ignored according to the audit configuration.
* `vulnerable_artifacts_count` - Count of non-ignored vulnerable application dependencies.
* `vulnerable_artifacts_count_with_ignored` - Count of all vulnerable application dependencies.
