			They are distinguished from `metadata` fields in that these can be nested JSON objects (whereas `metadata` fields are string/string maps only).

			The combined size of the `metadata` and `extendedMetadata` objects can be a maximum of 32,000 bytes. 
		* `fault_domain` - A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.

			If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for you.

			 To get a list of fault domains, use the [ListFaultDomains](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains) operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

		* `ipxe_script` - This is an advanced option.

			When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.

			If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.

			The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

			For more information about the Bring Your Own Image feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see [Bring Your Own Image](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm).

				The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

For information about how to take advantage of user data, see the [Cloud-Init Documentation](http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/format.html).

				**Metadata Example**

				"metadata" : { "quake_bot_level" : "Severe", "ssh_authorized_keys" : "ssh-rsa <your_public_SSH_key>== rsa-key-20160227", "user_data" : "<your_public_SSH_key>==" } **Getting Metadata on the Instance**

If you add a secondary VNIC to one of these instances, you can specify which NIC the VNIC will use. For more information, see [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm). 
	* `secondary_vnics` - Secondary VNIC parameters.
		* `create_vnic_details` - Contains the properties of the VNIC for an instance configuration. See [CreateVnicDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/CreateVnicDetails/) and [Instance Configurations](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Concepts/instancemanagement.htm#config) for more information. 
			* `assign_ipv6ip` - Whether to allocate an IPv6 address at instance and VNIC creation from an IPv6 enabled subnet. Default: False. When provided you may optionally provide an IPv6 prefix (`ipv6SubnetCidr`) of your choice to assign the IPv6 address from. If `ipv6SubnetCidr` is not provided then an IPv6 prefix is chosen for you. 
			* `assign_private_dns_record` - Whether the VNIC should be assigned a private DNS record. See the `assignPrivateDnsRecord` attribute of [CreateVnicDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/CreateVnicDetails/) for more information.
			* `assign_public_ip` - Whether the VNIC should be assigned a public IP address. See the `assignPublicIp` attribute of [CreateVnicDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/CreateVnicDetails/) for more information. 
			* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
			* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
			* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
			* `hostname_label` - The hostname for the VNIC's primary private IP. See the `hostnameLabel` attribute of [CreateVnicDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/CreateVnicDetails/) for more information. 
			* `ipv6address_ipv6subnet_cidr_pair_details` - A list of IPv6 prefix ranges from which the VNIC should be assigned an IPv6 address. You can provide only the prefix ranges and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure selects an available address from the range. You can optionally choose to leave the prefix range empty and instead provide the specific IPv6 address that should be used from within that range. 
				* `ipv6address` - Optional. An available IPv6 address of your subnet from a valid IPv6 prefix on the subnet (otherwise the IP address is automatically assigned). 
				* `ipv6subnet_cidr` - Optional. Used to disambiguate which subnet prefix should be used to create an IPv6 allocation. 
			* `nsg_ids` - A list of the OCIDs of the network security groups (NSGs) to add the VNIC to. For more information about NSGs, see [NetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/NetworkSecurityGroup/).
