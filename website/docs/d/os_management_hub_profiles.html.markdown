# Data Source: oci_os_management_hub_profiles
This data source provides the list of Profiles in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Os Management Hub service.

Lists registration profiles that match the specified compartment or profile OCID. Filter the list against a 
variety of criteria including but not limited to its name, status, vendor name, and architecture type.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_os_management_hub_profiles" "test_profiles" {

	#Optional

	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.profile_display_name
	display_name_contains = var.profile_display_name_contains
	is_default_profile = var.profile_is_default_profile
	is_service_provided_profile = var.profile_is_service_provided_profile
	management_station = var.profile_management_station
	management_station_not_equal_to = var.profile_management_station_not_equal_to
	os_family = var.profile_os_family
	profile_id = oci_os_management_hub_profile.test_profile.id
	profile_type = var.profile_profile_type
	profile_version = var.profile_profile_version
	registration_type = var.profile_registration_type
	state = var.profile_state
	vendor_name = var.profile_vendor_name
}
```

* `management_station` - (Optional) A filter to return resources that are associated with the specified management  station [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm). 
* `management_station_not_equal_to` - (Optional) A filter to return resources that aren't associated with the specified management  station [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm). 
* `os_family` - (Applicable when profile_type=SOFTWARESOURCE | STATION | WINDOWS_STANDALONE) A filter to return only resources that match the given operating system family.
* `profile_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the registration profile. A filter used to return the specified profile.
* `profile_type` - (Optional) A filter to return registration profiles that match the given profile type.
* `profile_version` - (Optional) The version of the registration profile.
* `registration_type` - (Optional) A filter to return profiles that match the given instance type.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `profile_collection` - The list of profile_collection.

### Profile Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `arch_type` - The architecture type.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment that contains the registration profile.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - The description of the registration profile.
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name for the profile.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the registration profile.
* `is_default_profile` - Indicates if the profile is set as the default. There is exactly one default profile for a specified architecture, OS family, registration type, and vendor. When registering an instance with the corresonding characteristics, the default profile is used, unless another profile is specified. 
* `is_service_provided_profile` - Indicates if the profile was created by the service. OS Management Hub provides a limited set of standardized profiles that can be used to register Autonomous Linux or Windows instances. 
* `lifecycle_environment` - Provides identifying information for the specified lifecycle environment.
	* `display_name` - Lifecycle environment name.
	* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the lifecycle environment.

	* `display_name` - Lifecycle stage name.
	* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the lifecycle stage.
* `managed_instance_group` - Provides identifying information for the specified managed instance group.
	* `display_name` - Managed instance group name.
