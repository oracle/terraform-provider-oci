# Data Source: oci_redis_redis_clusters
This data source provides the list of Redis Clusters in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Redis service.

Lists the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cache clusters in the specified compartment. A cluster is a memory-based storage solution. For more information, see [OCI Cache](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ocicache/home.htm).


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_redis_redis_clusters" "test_redis_clusters" {

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.redis_cluster_display_name
	id = var.redis_cluster_id
	state = var.redis_cluster_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Optional) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm#Oracle) of the cluster.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources their lifecycleState matches the given lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `redis_cluster_collection` - The list of redis_cluster_collection.

### RedisCluster Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `cluster_mode` - Specifies whether the cluster is sharded or non-sharded.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm#Oracle) of the compartment that contains the cluster.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm#Oracle) of the cluster.
* `lifecycle_details` - A message describing the current state in more detail. For example, the message might provide actionable information for a resource in `FAILED` state.
* `node_collection` - The collection of  cluster nodes.
	* `items` - Collection of node objects.
		* `display_name` - A user-friendly name of a cluster node.
		* `private_endpoint_fqdn` - The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the API endpoint to access a specific node.
		* `private_endpoint_ip_address` - The private IP address of the API endpoint to access a specific node.
* `node_count` - The number of nodes per shard in the cluster when clusterMode is SHARDED. This is the total number of nodes when clusterMode is NONSHARDED.
* `node_memory_in_gbs` - The amount of memory allocated to the cluster's nodes, in gigabytes.
* `nsg_ids` - A list of Network Security Group (NSG) [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) associated with this cluster. For more information, see [Using an NSG for Clusters](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ocicache/connecttocluster.htm#connecttocluster__networksecuritygroup). 
* `oci_cache_config_set_id` - The ID of the corresponding Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cache Config Set for the cluster.
* `primary_endpoint_ip_address` - The private IP address of the API endpoint for the cluster's primary node.
* `primary_fqdn` - The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the API endpoint for the cluster's primary node.
* `replicas_endpoint_ip_address` - The private IP address of the API endpoint for the cluster's replica nodes.
* `replicas_fqdn` - The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the API endpoint for the cluster's replica nodes.
* `shard_count` - The number of shards in a sharded cluster. Only applicable when clusterMode is SHARDED.
* `software_version` - The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cache engine version that the cluster is running.
* `state` - The current state of the cluster.
* `subnet_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm#Oracle) of the cluster's subnet.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - The date and time the cluster was created. An [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) formatted datetime string.
* `time_updated` - The date and time the cluster was updated. An [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) formatted datetime string.
