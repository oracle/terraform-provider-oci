# Data Source: oci_apm_synthetics_on_premise_vantage_point_worker
This data source provides details about a specific On Premise Vantage Point Worker resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure APM Availability Monitoring service (aka APM Synthetics Service).

Gets the details of the worker identified by the OCID.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_apm_synthetics_on_premise_vantage_point_worker" "test_on_premise_vantage_point_worker" {
	#Required
	apm_domain_id = oci_apm_apm_domain.test_apm_domain.id
	on_premise_vantage_point_id = oci_apm_synthetics_on_premise_vantage_point.test_on_premise_vantage_point.id
	worker_id = oci_apm_synthetics_worker.test_worker.id
}
```
