# Data Source: oci_data_safe_masking_analytics

is equivalent to accessLevel "ACCESSIBLE" by default.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_data_safe_masking_analytics" "test_masking_analytics" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.masking_analytic_compartment_id_in_subtree
	group_by = var.masking_analytic_group_by
	masking_policy_id = oci_data_safe_masking_policy.test_masking_policy.id
	target_id = oci_cloud_guard_target.test_target.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) A filter to return only resources that match the specified compartment OCID.
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned. Depends on the 'accessLevel' setting. 
* `group_by` - (Optional) Attribute by which the masking analytics data should be grouped.
