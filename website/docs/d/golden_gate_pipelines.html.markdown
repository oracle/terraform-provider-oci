# Data Source: oci_golden_gate_pipelines
This data source provides the list of Pipelines in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Golden Gate service.

Lists the Pipelines in the compartment.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_golden_gate_pipelines" "test_pipelines" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.pipeline_display_name
	lifecycle_sub_state = var.pipeline_lifecycle_sub_state
	state = var.pipeline_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment that contains the work request. Work requests should be scoped  to the same compartment as the resource the work request affects. If the work request concerns  multiple resources, and those resources are not in the same compartment, it is up to the service team  to pick the primary resource whose compartment should be used. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only the resources that match the entire 'displayName' given. 
* `lifecycle_sub_state` - (Optional) A filtered list of pipelines to return for a given lifecycleSubState. 
* `state` - (Optional) A filtered list of pipelines to return for a given lifecycleState. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `pipeline_collection` - The list of pipeline_collection.

### Pipeline Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment being referenced. 
* `cpu_core_count` - The Minimum number of OCPUs to be made available for this Deployment. 
* `defined_tags` - Tags defined for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace.  Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - Metadata about this specific object. 
* `display_name` - An object's Display Name. 
* `freeform_tags` - A simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type, or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only.  Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the pipeline. This option applies when retrieving a pipeline. 
* `is_auto_scaling_enabled` - Indicates if auto scaling is enabled for the Deployment's CPU core count. 
* `license_model` - The Oracle license model that applies to a Deployment. 
* `lifecycle_details` - Describes the object's current state in detail. For example, it can be used to provide actionable information for a resource in a Failed state. 
* `lifecycle_sub_state` - Possible lifecycle substates when retrieving a pipeline. 
* `locks` - Locks associated with this resource.
	* `message` - A message added by the creator of the lock. This is typically used to give an indication of why the resource is locked. 
	* `related_resource_id` - The id of the resource that is locking this resource. Indicates that deleting this resource will remove the lock. 
	* `time_created` - When the lock was created.
	* `type` - Type of the lock.
* `mapping_rules` - Mapping for source/target schema/tables for the pipeline data replication. 
	* `mapping_type` - Defines the exclude/include rules of source and target schemas and tables when replicating from source to target. This option applies when creating and updating a pipeline. 
	* `source` - The source schema/table combination for replication to target. 
	* `target` - The target schema/table combination for replication from the source. 
* `process_options` - Required pipeline options to configure the replication process (Extract or Replicat). 
	* `initial_data_load` - Options required for the pipeline Initial Data Load. If enabled, copies existing data from source to target before replication. 
		* `action_on_existing_table` - Action upon existing tables in target when initial Data Load is set i.e., isInitialLoad=true. 
		* `is_initial_load` - If ENABLED, then existing source data is also synchronized to the target when creating or updating the pipeline. 
	* `replicate_schema_change` - Options required for pipeline Initial Data Load. If enabled, copies existing data from source to target before replication. 
		* `action_on_ddl_error` - Action upon DDL Error (active only if 'Replicate schema changes (DDL)' is selected) i.e canReplicateSchemaChange=true 
		* `action_on_dml_error` - Action upon DML Error (active only if 'Replicate schema changes (DDL)' is selected) i.e canReplicateSchemaChange=true 
		* `can_replicate_schema_change` - If ENABLED, then addition or removal of schema is also replicated, apart from individual tables and records when creating or updating the pipeline. 
	* `should_restart_on_failure` - If ENABLED, then the replication process restarts itself upon failure. This option applies when creating or updating a pipeline. 
* `recipe_type` - The type of the recipe 
* `source_connection_details` - The source connection details for creating a pipeline. 
	* `connection_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the connection being referenced. 
* `state` - Lifecycle state of the pipeline. 
* `system_tags` - The system tags associated with this resource, if any. The system tags are set by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Each key is predefined and scoped to namespaces.  For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{orcl-cloud: {free-tier-retain: true}}` 
* `target_connection_details` - The target connection details for creating a pipeline. 
	* `connection_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the connection being referenced. 
* `time_created` - The time the resource was created. The format is defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339), such as `2016-08-25T21:10:29.600Z`. 
* `time_last_recorded` - When the resource was last updated. This option applies when retrieving a pipeline. The format is defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339), such as `2024-07-25T21:10:29.600Z`. 
* `time_updated` - The time the resource was last updated. The format is defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339), such as `2016-08-25T21:10:29.600Z`.
