# Data Source: oci_jms_fleet_installation_sites
This data source provides the list of Fleet Installation Sites in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Jms service.

List Java installation sites in a Fleet filtered by query parameters.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_jms_fleet_installation_sites" "test_fleet_installation_sites" {
	#Required
	fleet_id = oci_jms_fleet.test_fleet.id

	#Optional
	application_id = var.fleet_installation_site_application_id
	installation_path = var.fleet_installation_site_installation_path
	jre_distribution = var.fleet_installation_site_jre_distribution
	jre_security_status = var.fleet_installation_site_jre_security_status
	jre_vendor = var.fleet_installation_site_jre_vendor
	jre_version = var.fleet_installation_site_jre_version
	managed_instance_id = var.fleet_installation_site_managed_instance_id
	os_family = var.fleet_installation_site_os_family
	path_contains = var.fleet_installation_site_path_contains
	time_end = var.fleet_installation_site_time_end
	time_start = var.fleet_installation_site_time_start
}
```
