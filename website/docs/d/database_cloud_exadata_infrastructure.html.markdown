# Data Source: oci_database_cloud_exadata_infrastructure
This data source provides details about a specific Cloud Exadata Infrastructure resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets information about the specified cloud Exadata infrastructure resource. Applies to Exadata Cloud Service instances and Autonomous Database on dedicated Exadata infrastructure only.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_cloud_exadata_infrastructure" "test_cloud_exadata_infrastructure" {
	#Required
	cloud_exadata_infrastructure_id = oci_database_cloud_exadata_infrastructure.test_cloud_exadata_infrastructure.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cloud_exadata_infrastructure_id` - (Required) The cloud Exadata infrastructure [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

* `defined_file_system_configurations` - Details of the file system configuration of the Exadata infrastructure.
	* `is_backup_partition` - If true, the file system is used to create a backup prior to Exadata VM OS update.
	* `is_resizable` - If true, the file system resize is allowed for the Exadata Infrastructure cluster. If false, the file system resize is not allowed.
	* `min_size_gb` - The minimum size of file system.
	* `mount_point` - The mount point of file system.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name for the cloud Exadata infrastructure resource. The name does not need to be unique.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the cloud Exadata infrastructure resource.
* `last_maintenance_run_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last maintenance run.
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `maintenance_window` - The scheduling details for the quarterly maintenance window. Patching and system updates take place during the maintenance window. 
	* `custom_action_timeout_in_mins` - Determines the amount of time the system will wait before the start of each database server patching operation. Custom action timeout is in minutes and valid value is between 15 to 120 (inclusive). 
	* `days_of_week` - Days during the week when maintenance should be performed.
		* `name` - Name of the day of the week.
	* `hours_of_day` - The window of hours during the day when maintenance should be performed. The window is a 4 hour slot. Valid values are
		* 0 - represents time slot 0:00 - 3:59 UTC - 4 - represents time slot 4:00 - 7:59 UTC - 8 - represents time slot 8:00 - 11:59 UTC - 12 - represents time slot 12:00 - 15:59 UTC - 16 - represents time slot 16:00 - 19:59 UTC - 20 - represents time slot 20:00 - 23:59 UTC
	* `is_custom_action_timeout_enabled` - If true, enables the configuration of a custom action timeout (waiting period) between database server patching operations.
	* `is_monthly_patching_enabled` - If true, enables the monthly patching option.
	* `lead_time_in_weeks` - Lead time window allows user to set a lead time to prepare for a down time. The lead time is in weeks and valid value is between 1 to 4. 
	* `months` - Months during the year when maintenance should be performed.
		* `name` - Name of the month of the year.
	* `patching_mode` - Cloud Exadata infrastructure node patching method, either "ROLLING" or "NONROLLING". Default value is ROLLING.

		*IMPORTANT*: Non-rolling infrastructure patching involves system down time. See [Oracle-Managed Infrastructure Maintenance Updates](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/examaintenance.htm#Oracle) for more information. 
	* `preference` - The maintenance window scheduling preference.
	* `weeks_of_month` - Weeks during the month when maintenance should be performed. Weeks start on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd days of the month, and have a duration of 7 days. Weeks start and end based on calendar dates, not days of the week. For example, to allow maintenance during the 2nd week of the month (from the 8th day to the 14th day of the month), use the value 2. Maintenance cannot be scheduled for the fifth week of months that contain more than 28 days. Note that this parameter works in conjunction with the  daysOfWeek and hoursOfDay parameters to allow you to specify specific days of the week and hours that maintenance will be performed.
