# Data Source: oci_database_database
This data source provides details about a specific Database resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Gets information about the specified database.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_database" "test_database" {
	#Required
	database_id = var.database_id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `database_id` - (Required) The database [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `character_set` - The character set for the database.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `connection_strings` - The Connection strings used to connect to the Oracle Database.
	* `all_connection_strings` - All connection strings to use to connect to the Database.
	* `cdb_default` - Host name based CDB Connection String.
	* `cdb_ip_default` - IP based CDB Connection String.
* `database_management_config` - The configuration of the Database Management service.
	* `management_status` - The status of the Database Management service.
	* `management_type` - The Database Management type.
* `database_software_image_id` - The database software image [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)
* `db_backup_config` - Backup Options To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm). 
	* `auto_backup_enabled` - If set to true, configures automatic backups. If you previously used RMAN or dbcli to configure backups and then you switch to using the Console or the API for backups, a new backup configuration is created and associated with your database. This means that you can no longer rely on your previously configured unmanaged backups to work.
	* `auto_backup_window` - Time window selected for initiating automatic backup for the database system. There are twelve available two-hour time windows. If no option is selected, a start time between 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the region of the database is automatically chosen. For example, if the user selects SLOT_TWO from the enum list, the automatic backup job will start in between 2:00 AM (inclusive) to 4:00 AM (exclusive).  Example: `SLOT_TWO` 
	* `backup_destination_details` - Backup destination details.
		* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup destination.
		* `type` - Type of the database backup destination.
	* `recovery_window_in_days` - Number of days between the current and the earliest point of recoverability covered by automatic backups. This value applies to automatic backups only. After a new automatic backup has been created, Oracle removes old automatic backups that are created before the window. When the value is updated, it is applied to all existing automatic backups. 
* `db_home_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Database Home.
* `db_name` - The database name.
* `db_system_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DB system.
* `db_unique_name` - A system-generated name for the database to ensure uniqueness within an Oracle Data Guard group (a primary database and its standby databases). The unique name cannot be changed. 
* `db_workload` - The database workload type.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the database.
* `is_cdb` - True if the database is a container database.
* `kms_key_id` - The OCID of the key container that is used as the master encryption key in database transparent data encryption (TDE) operations.
* `last_backup_timestamp` - The date and time when the latest database backup was created.
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `ncharacter_set` - The national character set for the database.
* `pdb_name` - The name of the pluggable database. The name must begin with an alphabetic character and can contain a maximum of thirty alphanumeric characters. Special characters are not permitted. Pluggable database should not be same as database name.
* `sid_prefix` - Specifies a prefix for the `Oracle SID` of the database to be created. 
* `source_database_point_in_time_recovery_timestamp` - Point in time recovery timeStamp of the source database at which cloned database system is cloned from the source database system, as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
* `state` - The current state of the database.
* `time_created` - The date and time the database was created.
* `vm_cluster_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM cluster.
