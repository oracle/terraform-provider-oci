# Data Source: oci_file_storage_snapshot
This data source provides details about a specific Snapshot resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage service.

Gets the specified snapshot's information.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_file_storage_snapshot" "test_snapshot" {
	#Required
	snapshot_id = oci_file_storage_snapshot.test_snapshot.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `snapshot_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the snapshot.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `expiration_time` - The time when this snapshot will be deleted.
* `file_system_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the file system from which the snapshot was created. 
* `filesystem_snapshot_policy_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the file system snapshot policy that created this snapshot. 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the snapshot.
* `is_clone_source` - Specifies whether the snapshot has been cloned. See [Cloning a File System](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/cloningFS.htm). 
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current `lifecycleState`.
* `locks` - Locks associated with this resource.
	* `message` - A message added by the creator of the lock. This is typically used to give an indication of why the resource is locked. 
	* `related_resource_id` - The ID of the resource that is locking this resource. Indicates that deleting this resource will remove the lock. 
	* `time_created` - When the lock was created.
	* `type` - Type of the lock.
* `name` - Name of the snapshot. This value is immutable.

	Avoid entering confidential information.

	Example: `Sunday` 
* `provenance_id` - An [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) identifying the parent from which this snapshot was cloned. If this snapshot was not cloned, then the `provenanceId` is the same as the snapshot `id` value. If this snapshot was cloned, then the `provenanceId` value is the parent's `provenanceId`. See [Cloning a File System](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/cloningFS.htm). 
* `snapshot_time` - The date and time the snapshot was taken, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339) timestamp format. This value might be the same or different from `timeCreated` depending on the following factors:
	* If the snapshot is created in the original file system directory.
	* If the snapshot is cloned from a file system.
	* If the snapshot is replicated from a file system.

	Example: `2020-08-25T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `snapshot_type` - Specifies the generation type of the snapshot. 
* `state` - The current state of the snapshot.
* `system_tags` - System tags for this resource. System tags are applied to resources by internal Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. 
* `time_created` - The date and time the snapshot was created, expressed in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339) timestamp format.  Example: `2016-08-25T21:10:29.600Z`
