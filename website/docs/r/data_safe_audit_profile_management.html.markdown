# oci_data_safe_audit_profile_management
This resource provides the Audit Profile Management resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Create a new audit profile resource for a target group. For a target database, it will update the auto created audit profile by fetching the Audit profile.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_data_safe_audit_profile_management" "test_audit_profile_management" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	target_id = oci_cloud_guard_target.test_target.id
	target_type = var.audit_profile_target_type

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.audit_profile_description
	display_name = var.audit_profile_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	is_override_global_paid_usage = var.audit_profile_is_override_global_paid_usage
	is_paid_usage_enabled = var.audit_profile_is_paid_usage_enabled
	offline_months = var.audit_profile_offline_months
	online_months = var.audit_profile_online_months
	change_retention_trigger= var.retention_trigger
    is_override_global_retention_setting = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment where you want to create the audit profile.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) The description of the audit profile.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The display name of the audit profile. The name does not have to be unique, and it's updatable.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm)  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_override_global_paid_usage` - (Optional) Indicates whether audit paid usage settings specified at the target database level override both the global and the target database group level paid usage settings. Enabling paid usage continues the collection of audit records beyond the free limit of one million audit records per month per target database, potentially incurring additional charges. For more information, see [Data Safe Price List](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/price-list/#data-safe). 
* `is_paid_usage_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates if you want to continue collecting audit records beyond the free limit of one million audit records per month per target database, potentially incurring additional charges. The default value is inherited from the global settings.  You can change at the global level or at the target level. 
* `offline_months` - (Optional) Number of months the audit records will be stored offline in the offline archive. Minimum: 0; Maximum: 72 months. If you have a requirement to store the audit data even longer in the offline archive, please contact the Oracle Support. 
* `online_months` - (Optional) Number of months the audit records will be stored online in the audit repository for immediate reporting and analysis. Minimum: 1; Maximum: 12 months 
* `target_id` - (Required) The OCID of the target database or target database group for which the audit profile is created.
* `target_type` - (Required) The resource type that is represented by the audit profile.
* `change_retention_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when incremented triggers Change Retention. Could be set to any integer value.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
