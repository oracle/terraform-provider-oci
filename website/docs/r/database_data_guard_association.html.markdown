# oci_database_data_guard_association
This resource provides the Data Guard Association resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Creates a new Data Guard association.  A Data Guard association represents the replication relationship between the
specified database and a peer database. For more information, see [Using Oracle Data Guard](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Tasks/usingdataguard.htm).

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including Data Guard associations, get an Oracle-assigned, unique ID
called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response.
You can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the
resource in the Console. For more information, see
[Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

	* `is_health_monitoring_enabled` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) Indicates whether health monitoring is enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling health monitoring allows Oracle to collect diagnostic data and share it with its operations and support personnel. You may also receive notifications for some events. Collecting health diagnostics enables Oracle to provide proactive support and enhanced service for your system. Optionally enable health monitoring while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable health monitoring anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `UpdateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
	* `is_incident_logs_enabled` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) Indicates whether incident logs and trace collection are enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling incident logs collection allows Oracle to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues, collect incident logs and traces, and use them to diagnose issues and resolve them. Optionally enable incident logs collection while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable incident logs collection anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `updateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
* `database_admin_password` - (Required) (Updatable) A strong password for the `SYS`, `SYSTEM`, and `PDB Admin` users to apply during standby creation.

    The password must contain no fewer than nine characters and include:
    * At least two uppercase characters.
    * At least two lowercase characters.
    * At least two numeric characters.
    * At least two special characters. Valid special characters include "_", "#", and "-" only.

	**The password MUST be the same as the primary admin password.** 
* `database_defined_tags` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).

* `db_system_security_attributes` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) Security Attributes for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Oracle-ZPR": {"MaxEgressCount": {"value": "42", "mode": "audit"}}}` 
* `delete_standby_db_home_on_delete` - (Required) (Updatable) if set to true the destroy operation will destroy the standby dbHome/dbSystem that is referenced in the Data Guard Association. The Data Guard Association gets destroyed when standby dbHome/dbSystem is terminated. Only `true` is supported at this time. If you change an argument that is used during the delete operation you must run `terraform apply` first so that that the change in the value is registered in the statefile before running `terraform destroy`. `terraform destroy` only looks at what is currently on the statefile and ignores the terraform configuration files. 
* `display_name` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) The user-friendly name of the DB system that will contain the the standby database. The display name does not have to be unique.
* `domain` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) A domain name used for the DB system. If the Oracle-provided Internet and VCN Resolver is enabled for the specified subnet, the domain name for the subnet is used (do not provide one). Otherwise, provide a valid DNS domain name. Hyphens (-) are not permitted. 
* `fault_domains` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) A Fault Domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Fault Domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that affects one Fault Domain does not affect DB systems in other Fault Domains.

	If you do not specify the Fault Domain, the system selects one for you. To change the Fault Domain for a DB system, terminate it and launch a new DB system in the preferred Fault Domain.

	If the node count is greater than 1, you can specify which Fault Domains these nodes will be distributed into. The system assigns your nodes automatically to the Fault Domains you specify so that no Fault Domain contains more than one node.

	To get a list of Fault Domains, use the [ListFaultDomains](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/latest/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains) operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

	Example: `FAULT-DOMAIN-1` 
* `hostname` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) The hostname for the DB node.
* `is_active_data_guard_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) True if active Data Guard is enabled.
* `license_model` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) The Oracle license model that applies to all the databases on the dataguard standby DB system. The default is LICENSE_INCLUDED. Bring your own license (BYOL) allows you to select the DB edition using the optional parameter, for Autonomous Database Serverless. 
* `node_count` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) The number of nodes to launch for the DB system of the standby in the Data Guard association. For a 2-node RAC virtual machine DB system, specify either 1 or 2. If you do not supply this parameter, the default is the node count of the primary DB system. 
* `nsg_ids` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) The list of [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the network security groups (NSGs) to which this resource belongs. Setting this to an empty list removes all resources from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see [Security Rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm). **NsgIds restrictions:**
	* A network security group (NSG) is optional for Autonomous Databases with private access. The nsgIds list can be empty.
* `peer_db_home_id` - (Applicable when creation_type=ExistingDbSystem | ExistingVmCluster) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DB home in which to create the standby database. You must supply this value to create standby database with an existing DB home 
* `peer_db_system_id` - (Applicable when creation_type=ExistingDbSystem) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DB system in which to create the standby database. You must supply this value if creationType is `ExistingDbSystem`. 
* `peer_db_unique_name` - (Optional) Specifies the `DB_UNIQUE_NAME` of the peer database to be created. 
* `peer_sid_prefix` - (Optional) Specifies a prefix for the `Oracle SID` of the database to be created. 
* `peer_vm_cluster_id` - (Applicable when creation_type=ExistingVmCluster) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM Cluster in which to create the standby database. You must supply this value if creationType is `ExistingVmCluster`. 
* `private_ip` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) The IPv4 address from the provided Oracle Cloud Infrastructure subnet which needs to be assigned to the VNIC. If not provided, it will be auto-assigned with an available IPv4 address from the subnet. 
* `protection_mode` - (Required) (Updatable) The protection mode to set up between the primary and standby databases. For more information, see [Oracle Data Guard Protection Modes](http://docs.oracle.com/database/122/SBYDB/oracle-data-guard-protection-modes.htm#SBYDB02000) in the Oracle Data Guard documentation.

    **IMPORTANT** - The only protection mode currently supported by the Database service is MAXIMUM_PERFORMANCE. 
* `shape` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) The virtual machine DB system shape to launch for the standby database in the Data Guard association. The shape determines the number of CPU cores and the amount of memory available for the DB system. Only virtual machine shapes are valid options. If you do not supply this parameter, the default shape is the shape of the primary DB system.

	To get a list of all shapes, use the [ListDbSystemShapes](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/database/latest/DbSystemShapeSummary/ListDbSystemShapes) operation. 
* `storage_volume_performance_mode` - (Applicable when creation_type=NewDbSystem) The block storage volume performance level. Valid values are `BALANCED` and `HIGH_PERFORMANCE`.
