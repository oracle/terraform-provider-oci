# oci_bds_bds_instance_patch_action
This resource provides the Bds Instance Patch Action resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Big Data Service service.

Install the specified patch to this cluster.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_bds_bds_instance_patch_action" "test_bds_instance_patch_action" {
	#Required
	bds_instance_id = oci_bds_bds_instance.test_bds_instance.id
	cluster_admin_password = var.bds_instance_patch_action_cluster_admin_password
	version = var.bds_instance_patch_action_version

	#Optional
	patching_config {
		#Required
		patching_config_strategy = var.bds_instance_patch_action_patching_config_patching_config_strategy

		#Optional
		batch_size = var.bds_instance_patch_action_patching_config_batch_size
		tolerance_threshold_per_batch = var.bds_instance_patch_action_patching_config_tolerance_threshold_per_batch
		tolerance_threshold_per_domain = var.bds_instance_patch_action_patching_config_tolerance_threshold_per_domain
		wait_time_between_batch_in_seconds = var.bds_instance_patch_action_patching_config_wait_time_between_batch_in_seconds
		wait_time_between_domain_in_seconds = var.bds_instance_patch_action_patching_config_wait_time_between_domain_in_seconds
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bds_instance_id` - (Required) The OCID of the cluster.
* `cluster_admin_password` - (Required) Base-64 encoded password for the cluster admin user.
* `patching_config` - (Optional) Detailed configurations for defining the behavior when installing ODH patches. If not provided, nodes will be patched with down time.
	* `batch_size` - (Required when patching_config_strategy=BATCHING_BASED) How many nodes to be patched in each iteration.
	* `patching_config_strategy` - (Required) Type of strategy used for detailed patching configuration
	* `tolerance_threshold_per_batch` - (Applicable when patching_config_strategy=BATCHING_BASED) Acceptable number of failed-to-be-patched nodes in each batch. The maximum number of failed-to-patch nodes cannot exceed 20% of the number of non-utility and non-master nodes.
	* `tolerance_threshold_per_domain` - (Applicable when patching_config_strategy=DOMAIN_BASED) Acceptable number of failed-to-be-patched nodes in each domain. The maximum number of failed-to-patch nodes cannot exceed 20% of the number of non-utility and non-master nodes.
	* `wait_time_between_batch_in_seconds` - (Required when patching_config_strategy=BATCHING_BASED) The wait time between batches in seconds.
	* `wait_time_between_domain_in_seconds` - (Required when patching_config_strategy=DOMAIN_BASED) The wait time between AD/FD in seconds.
* `version` - (Required) The version of the patch to be installed.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
