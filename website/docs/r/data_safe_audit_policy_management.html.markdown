# oci_data_safe_audit_policy_management
This resource provides the Audit Policy Management resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Updates the audit policy.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_data_safe_audit_policy_management" "test_audit_policy_management" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	target_id = oci_data_safe_target_database.test_target_database.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.audit_policy_management_description
	display_name = var.audit_policy_management_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	retrieve_from_target_trigger = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `audit_policy_id` - (Required) Unique audit policy identifier.
* `compartment_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment containing the audit policy.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}`
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) The description of the audit policy.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The display name of the audit policy. The name does not have to be unique, and it is changeable.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm)  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `provision_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when set to true triggers Provision.
* `retrieve_from_target_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when set to true triggers Retrieve From Target.
* `audit_conditions` - (Optional) Required when provision_trigger is set. Lists the audit policy provisioning conditions for the target database.
	* `audit_policy_name` - Indicates the audit policy name. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/data-safe/udscs/audit-policies.html#GUID-361A9A9A-7C21-4F5A-8945-9B3A0C472827) for seeded audit policy names. For custom policies, refer to the user-defined policy name created in the target database.
	* `enable_conditions` - Indicates the users/roles in the target database for which the audit policy is enforced, and the success/failure event condition to generate the audit event..
		* `entity_names` - List of users or roles that the policy must be enabled for.
		* `entity_selection` - The entity include or exclude selection.
		* `entity_type` - The entity type that the policy must be enabled for.
		* `operation_status` - The operation status that the policy must be enabled for.
	* `is_data_safe_service_account_audited` - Indicates whether the Data Safe user activity on the target database will be audited by the policy.
	* `is_enabled` - Indicates whether the policy has to be enabled or disabled in the target database. Set this to true if you want the audit policy to be enabled in the target database. If the seeded audit policy is not already created in the database, the provisioning creates and enables them. If this is set to false, the policy will be disabled in the target database.
	* `is_priv_users_managed_by_data_safe` - Indicates whether the privileged user list is managed by Data Safe.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
