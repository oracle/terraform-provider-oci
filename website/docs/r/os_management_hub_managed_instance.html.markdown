## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_os_management_hub_managed_instance" "test_managed_instance" {
	#Required
	managed_instance_id = oci_os_management_hub_managed_instance.test_managed_instance.id

	#Optional
	autonomous_settings {

		#Optional
		is_data_collection_authorized = var.managed_instance_autonomous_settings_is_data_collection_authorized
	}
	description = var.managed_instance_description
	notification_topic_id = oci_ons_notification_topic.test_notification_topic.id
	primary_management_station_id = oci_os_management_hub_management_station.test_management_station.id
	secondary_management_station_id = oci_os_management_hub_management_station.test_management_station.id
}
```
