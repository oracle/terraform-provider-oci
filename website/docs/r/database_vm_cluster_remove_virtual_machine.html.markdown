# oci_database_vm_cluster_remove_virtual_machine
This resource provides the Vm Cluster Remove Virtual Machine resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Remove Virtual Machines from the VM cluster. Applies to Exadata Cloud@Customer instances only.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_database_vm_cluster_remove_virtual_machine" "test_vm_cluster_remove_virtual_machine" {
	#Required
	db_servers {
		#Required
		db_server_id = oci_database_db_server.test_db_server.id
	}
	vm_cluster_id = oci_database_vm_cluster.test_vm_cluster.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `db_servers` - (Required) The list of Exacc DB servers for the cluster to be removed.
	* `db_server_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of Exacc Db server.
* `vm_cluster_id` - (Required) The VM cluster [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `availability_domain` - The name of the availability domain that the VM cluster is located in.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `cpus_enabled` - The number of enabled CPU cores.
* `data_collection_options` - Indicates user preferences for the various diagnostic collection options for the VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster/VMBM DBCS. 
	* `is_diagnostics_events_enabled` - Indicates whether diagnostic collection is enabled for the VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster/VMBM DBCS. Enabling diagnostic collection allows you to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues. Diagnostic collection also allows Oracle to provide enhanced service and proactive support for your Exadata system. You can enable diagnostic collection during VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster provisioning. You can also disable or enable it at any time using the `UpdateVmCluster` or `updateCloudVmCluster` API. 
	* `is_health_monitoring_enabled` - Indicates whether health monitoring is enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling health monitoring allows Oracle to collect diagnostic data and share it with its operations and support personnel. You may also receive notifications for some events. Collecting health diagnostics enables Oracle to provide proactive support and enhanced service for your system. Optionally enable health monitoring while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable health monitoring anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `UpdateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
	* `is_incident_logs_enabled` - Indicates whether incident logs and trace collection are enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling incident logs collection allows Oracle to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues, collect incident logs and traces, and use them to diagnose issues and resolve them. Optionally enable incident logs collection while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable incident logs collection anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `updateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
* `data_storage_size_in_gb` - Size of the DATA disk group in GBs.
* `data_storage_size_in_tbs` - Size, in terabytes, of the DATA disk group.
* `db_node_storage_size_in_gbs` - The local node storage allocated in GBs.
* `db_servers` - The list of Db server.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name for the Exadata Cloud@Customer VM cluster. The name does not need to be unique.
* `exadata_infrastructure_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Exadata infrastructure.
* `file_system_configuration_details` - Details of the file system configuration of the VM cluster.
	* `file_system_size_gb` - The file system size to be allocated in GBs.
	* `mount_point` - The mount point of file system.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `gi_version` - The Oracle Grid Infrastructure software version for the VM cluster.
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM cluster.
* `is_local_backup_enabled` - If true, database backup on local Exadata storage is configured for the VM cluster. If false, database backup on local Exadata storage is not available in the VM cluster. 
* `is_sparse_diskgroup_enabled` - If true, sparse disk group is configured for the VM cluster. If false, sparse disk group is not created. 
* `last_patch_history_entry_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last patch history. This value is updated as soon as a patch operation starts.
* `license_model` - The Oracle license model that applies to the VM cluster. The default is LICENSE_INCLUDED. 
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `memory_size_in_gbs` - The memory allocated in GBs.
* `shape` - The shape of the Exadata infrastructure. The shape determines the amount of CPU, storage, and memory resources allocated to the instance. 
* `ssh_public_keys` - The public key portion of one or more key pairs used for SSH access to the VM cluster.
* `state` - The current state of the VM cluster.
* `system_version` - Operating system version of the image.
* `time_created` - The date and time that the VM cluster was created.
* `time_zone` - The time zone of the Exadata infrastructure. For details, see [Exadata Infrastructure Time Zones](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/References/timezones.htm).
* `vm_cluster_network_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM cluster network.
