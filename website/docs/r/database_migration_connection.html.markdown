# oci_database_migration_connection
This resource provides the Connection resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Migration service.

Create a Database Connection resource that contains the details to connect to either a Source or Target Database
in the migration.

Note: If you wish to use the DMS deprecated API version /20210929 it is necessary to pin the Terraform Provider version to v5.47.0. Newer Terraform provider versions will not support the DMS deprecated API version /20210929
