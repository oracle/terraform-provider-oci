```hcl
resource "oci_apigateway_api" "test_api" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	content = var.api_content
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = var.api_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	locks {
		#Required
		type = var.api_locks_type

		#Optional
		message = var.api_locks_message
	}
}
```

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment in which the resource is created. 
* `content` - (Optional) (Updatable) API Specification content in json or yaml format
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}`

* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `locks` - (Optional) Locks associated with this resource.
