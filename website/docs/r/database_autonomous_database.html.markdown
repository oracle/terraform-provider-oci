	Service Change: The default value of the isMTLSConnectionRequired attribute will change from true to false on July 1, 2023 in the following APIs:
	* CreateAutonomousDatabase
	* GetAutonomousDatabase
	* UpdateAutonomousDatabase Details: Prior to the July 1, 2023 change, the isMTLSConnectionRequired attribute default value was true. This applies to Autonomous Database Serverless. Does this impact me? If you use or maintain custom scripts or Terraform scripts referencing the CreateAutonomousDatabase, GetAutonomousDatabase, or UpdateAutonomousDatabase APIs, you want to check, and possibly modify, the scripts for the changed default value of the attribute. Should you choose not to leave your scripts unchanged, the API calls containing this attribute will continue to work, but the default value will switch from true to false. How do I make this change? Using either Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDKs or command line tools, update your custom scripts to explicitly set the isMTLSConnectionRequired attribute to true. 
* `is_preview_version_with_service_terms_accepted` - (Optional) If set to `TRUE`, indicates that an Autonomous Database preview version is being provisioned, and that the preview version's terms of service have been accepted. Note that preview version software is only available for Autonomous Database Serverless instances (https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/serverless/). 
* `is_replicate_automatic_backups` - (Applicable when source=CROSS_REGION_DISASTER_RECOVERY) If true, 7 days worth of backups are replicated across regions for Cross-Region ADB or Backup-Based DR between Primary and Standby. If false, the backups taken on the Primary are not replicated to the Standby database.
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the key container that is used as the master encryption key in database transparent data encryption (TDE) operations.
* `key_version_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the key version that is used in rotate key operations.
* `license_model` - (Optional) (Updatable) The Oracle license model that applies to the Oracle Autonomous Database. Bring your own license (BYOL) allows you to apply your current on-premises Oracle software licenses to equivalent, highly automated Oracle services in the cloud. License Included allows you to subscribe to new Oracle Database software licenses and the Oracle Database service. Note that when provisioning an [Autonomous Database on dedicated Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/index.html), this attribute must be null.

This feature is available for [Autonomous Database Serverless] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/index.html) and on Exadata Cloud@Customer. Only clients connecting from an IP address included in the ACL may access the Autonomous Database instance. If `arePrimaryWhitelistedIpsUsed` is 'TRUE' then Autonomous Database uses this primary's IP access control list (ACL) for the disaster recovery peer called `standbywhitelistedips`.

  For Autonomous Database Serverless instances, this is an array of CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations for a subnet or VCN OCID. Use a semicolon (;) as a deliminator between the VCN-specific subnets or IPs. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id>","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id1>;1.1.1.1","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id2>;1.1.0.0/16"]` For Exadata Cloud@Customer, this is an array of IP addresses or CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","1.1.2.25"]`

	For an update operation, if you want to delete all the IPs in the ACL, use an array with a single empty string entry.

    If `arePrimaryWhitelistedIpsUsed` is 'TRUE' then Autonomous Database uses `whitelisted_ips` primary's IP access control list (ACL) as `standbywhitelistedips` for the disaster recovery peer.

	This cannot be updated in parallel with any of the following: licenseModel, dbEdition, cpuCoreCount, computeCount, computeModel, adminPassword, isMTLSConnectionRequired, openMode, permissionLevel, dbWorkload, dbVersion, isRefreshable, dbName, scheduledOperations, dbToolsDetails, isLocalDataGuardEnabled, or isFreeTier.
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet the resource is associated with. This the only parameter to configure private endpoint, VCN details are obtained from the `subnet_id`.

  **Subnet Restrictions:**
	* For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28.
	* For Exadata and virtual machine 2-node RAC systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20.
	* For Autonomous Database, setting this will disable public secure access to the database.

* `subscription_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subscription with which resource needs to be associated with.
  These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet.

* `whitelisted_ips` - (Optional) (Updatable) The client IP access control list (ACL). This feature is available for autonomous databases on [shared Exadata infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/index.html) and on Exadata Cloud@Customer. Only clients connecting from an IP address included in the ACL may access the Autonomous Database instance.

  For Autonomous Database Serverless instances, this is an array of CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations for a subnet or VCN OCID. Use a semicolon (;) as a deliminator between the VCN-specific subnets or IPs. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id>","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id1>;1.1.1.1","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id2>;1.1.0.0/16"]` For Exadata Cloud@Customer, this is an array of IP addresses or CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","1.1.2.25"]`

	For an update operation, if you want to delete all the IPs in the ACL, use an array with a single empty string entry.

	This cannot be updated in parallel with any of the following: licenseModel, dbEdition, cpuCoreCount, computeCount, computeModel, adminPassword, isMTLSConnectionRequired, openMode, permissionLevel, dbWorkload, dbVersion, isRefreshable, dbName, scheduledOperations, dbToolsDetails, isLocalDataGuardEnabled, or isFreeTier. To remove all whitelisted IPs, set the field to a list with an empty string `[""]`.

* `switchover_to_remote_peer_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) It is applicable only when `dataguard_region_type` and `role` are set, and `is_dedicated` is false. For Autonomous Database Serverless instances, Data Guard associations have designated primary and standby regions, and these region types do not change when the database changes roles. It takes the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the remote peer to switchover to and the API is called from the remote region.
* `rotate_key_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when flipped triggers rotation of KMS key. It is only applicable on dedicated databases i.e. where `is_dedicated` is true.
* `is_shrink_only` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when enabled triggers the Shrinking of Autonomous Database once. To trigger Shrinking of ADB once again, this flag needs to be disabled and re-enabled again. It should not be passed during create database operation. It is only applicable on Serverless databases i.e. where `is_dedicated` is false.

** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

  These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet.
* `supported_regions_to_clone_to` - The list of regions that support the creation of an Autonomous Database clone or an Autonomous Data Guard standby database.
* `system_tags` - System tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).
* `time_created` - The date and time the Autonomous Database was created.
* `time_data_guard_role_changed` - The date and time the Autonomous Data Guard role was switched for the Autonomous Database. For databases that have standbys in both the primary Data Guard region and a remote Data Guard standby region, this is the latest timestamp of either the database using the "primary" role in the primary Data Guard region, or database located in the remote Data Guard standby region.
* `time_deletion_of_free_autonomous_database` - The date and time the Always Free database will be automatically deleted because of inactivity. If the database is in the STOPPED state and without activity until this time, it will be deleted.
* `time_disaster_recovery_role_changed` - The date and time the Disaster Recovery role was switched for the standby Autonomous Database.
* `time_local_data_guard_enabled` - The date and time that Autonomous Data Guard was enabled for an Autonomous Database where the standby was provisioned in the same region as the primary database.
* `time_maintenance_begin` - The date and time when maintenance will begin.
* `time_maintenance_end` - The date and time when maintenance will end.
* `time_of_auto_refresh_start` - The the date and time that auto-refreshing will begin for an Autonomous Database refreshable clone. This value controls only the start time for the first refresh operation. Subsequent (ongoing) refresh operations have start times controlled by the value of the `autoRefreshFrequencyInSeconds` parameter.
* `time_of_last_failover` - The timestamp of the last failover operation.
* `time_of_last_refresh` - The date and time when last refresh happened.
* `time_of_last_refresh_point` - The refresh point timestamp (UTC). The refresh point is the time to which the database was most recently refreshed. Data created after the refresh point is not included in the refresh.
* `time_of_last_switchover` - The timestamp of the last switchover operation for the Autonomous Database.
* `time_of_next_refresh` - The date and time of next refresh.
* `time_reclamation_of_free_autonomous_database` - The date and time the Always Free database will be stopped because of inactivity. If this time is reached without any database activity, the database will automatically be put into the STOPPED state.
* `time_until_reconnect_clone_enabled` - The time and date as an RFC3339 formatted string, e.g., 2022-01-01T12:00:00.000Z, to set the limit for a refreshable clone to be reconnected to its source database.
* `total_backup_storage_size_in_gbs` - The backup storage to the database.
* `used_data_storage_size_in_gbs` - The storage space consumed by Autonomous Database in GBs.
* `used_data_storage_size_in_tbs` - The amount of storage that has been used for Autonomous Databases in dedicated infrastructure, in terabytes.
* `vault_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm#concepts). This parameter and `secretId` are required for Customer Managed Keys.
* `whitelisted_ips` - The client IP access control list (ACL). This feature is available for [Autonomous Database Serverless] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/index.html) and on Exadata Cloud@Customer. Only clients connecting from an IP address included in the ACL may access the Autonomous Database instance. If `arePrimaryWhitelistedIpsUsed` is 'TRUE' then Autonomous Database uses this primary's IP access control list (ACL) for the disaster recovery peer called `standbywhitelistedips`.
* `is_disconnect_peer` - If true, this will disconnect the Autonomous Database from its peer and the Autonomous Database can work permanently as a standalone database. To disconnect a cross region standby, please also provide the OCID of the standby database in the `peerDbId` parameter.

	For Autonomous Database Serverless instances, this is an array of CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations for a subnet or VCN OCID. Use a semicolon (;) as a deliminator between the VCN-specific subnets or IPs. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id>","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id1>;1.1.1.1","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.<unique_id2>;1.1.0.0/16"]` For Exadata Cloud@Customer, this is an array of IP addresses or CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notations. Example: `["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","1.1.2.25"]`

	For an update operation, if you want to delete all the IPs in the ACL, use an array with a single empty string entry.

	This cannot be updated in parallel with any of the following: licenseModel, dbEdition, cpuCoreCount, computeCount, computeModel, adminPassword, isMTLSConnectionRequired, openMode, permissionLevel, dbWorkload, dbVersion, isRefreshable, dbName, scheduledOperations, dbToolsDetails, isLocalDataGuardEnabled, or isFreeTier.

  For an update operation, if you want to delete all the IPs in the ACL, use an array with a single empty string entry.
## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 12 hours), when creating the Autonomous Database
	* `update` - (Defaults to 12 hours), when updating the Autonomous Database
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 12 hours), when destroying the Autonomous Database


## Import

AutonomousDatabases can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_database_autonomous_database.test_autonomous_database "id"
```
