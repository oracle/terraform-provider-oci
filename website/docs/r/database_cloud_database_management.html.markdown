# oci_database_cloud_database_management
This resource provides the Database Management resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Enable / Update / Disable database management for the specified Oracle Database instance.

Database Management requires `USER_NAME`, `PASSWORD_SECRET_ID` and `PRIVATE_END_POINT_ID`.
`database.0.database_management_config` is updated to appropriate managementType and managementStatus for the specified Oracle Database instance.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_database_cloud_database_management" "test" {
  database_id           = oci_database_database.test_database.id
  management_type       = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_management_type
  private_end_point_id  = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_private_end_point_id
  service_name          = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_service_name
  credentialdetails {
    user_name           = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_user_name
    password_secret_id  = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_password_secret_id
  }
  enable_management     = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_enable_management
  port = var.cloud_database_management_port
  protocol = var.cloud_database_management_protocol
  role = var.cloud_database_management_role
  ssl_secret_id = oci_vault_secret.test_secret.id

	* `auto_backup_enabled` - If set to true, configures automatic backups. If you previously used RMAN or dbcli to configure backups and then you switch to using the Console or the API for backups, a new backup configuration is created and associated with your database. This means that you can no longer rely on your previously configured unmanaged backups to work.
	* `auto_backup_window` - Time window selected for initiating automatic backup for the database system. There are twelve available two-hour time windows. If no option is selected, a start time between 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the region of the database is automatically chosen. For example, if the user selects SLOT_TWO from the enum list, the automatic backup job will start in between 2:00 AM (inclusive) to 4:00 AM (exclusive).  Example: `SLOT_TWO` 
	* `auto_full_backup_day` - Day of the week the full backup should be applied on the database system. If no option is selected, the value is null and we will default to Sunday.
	* `auto_full_backup_window` - Time window selected for initiating full backup for the database system. There are twelve available two-hour time windows. If no option is selected, the value is null and a start time between 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the region of the database is automatically chosen. For example, if the user selects SLOT_TWO from the enum list, the automatic backup job will start in between 2:00 AM (inclusive) to 4:00 AM (exclusive).  Example: `SLOT_TWO`

	* `recovery_window_in_days` - Number of days between the current and the earliest point of recoverability covered by automatic backups. This value applies to automatic backups only. After a new automatic backup has been created, Oracle removes old automatic backups that are created before the window. When the value is updated, it is applied to all existing automatic backups.
