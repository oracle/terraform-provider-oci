# oci_database_cloud_database_management
This resource provides the Database Management resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Enable / Update / Disable database management for the specified Oracle Database instance.

Database Management requires `USER_NAME`, `PASSWORD_SECRET_ID` and `PRIVATE_END_POINT_ID`.
`database.0.database_management_config` is updated to appropriate managementType and managementStatus for the specified Oracle Database instance.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_database_cloud_database_management" "test" {
  database_id           = oci_database_database.test_database.id
  management_type       = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_management_type
  private_end_point_id  = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_private_end_point_id
  service_name          = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_service_name
  credentialdetails {
    user_name           = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_user_name
    password_secret_id  = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_password_secret_id
  }
  enable_management     = var.database_cloud_database_management_details_enable_management
  port = var.cloud_database_management_port
  protocol = var.cloud_database_management_protocol
  role = var.cloud_database_management_role
  ssl_secret_id = oci_vault_secret.test_secret.id
}
```

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `connection_strings` - The Connection strings used to connect to the Oracle Database.
	* `all_connection_strings` - All connection strings to use to connect to the Database.
	* `cdb_default` - Host name based CDB Connection String.
	* `cdb_ip_default` - IP based CDB Connection String.
* `database_management_config` - The configuration of the Database Management service.
	* `management_status` - The status of the Database Management service.
	* `management_type` - The Database Management type.
* `database_software_image_id` - The database software image [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)
* `db_backup_config` - Backup Options To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see [Getting Started with Policies](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm). 
	* `auto_backup_enabled` - If set to true, configures automatic backups. If you previously used RMAN or dbcli to configure backups and then you switch to using the Console or the API for backups, a new backup configuration is created and associated with your database. This means that you can no longer rely on your previously configured unmanaged backups to work.
	* `auto_backup_window` - Time window selected for initiating automatic backup for the database system. There are twelve available two-hour time windows. If no option is selected, a start time between 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the region of the database is automatically chosen. For example, if the user selects SLOT_TWO from the enum list, the automatic backup job will start in between 2:00 AM (inclusive) to 4:00 AM (exclusive).  Example: `SLOT_TWO` 
	* `auto_full_backup_day` - Day of the week the full backup should be applied on the database system. If no option is selected, the value is null and we will default to Sunday.
	* `auto_full_backup_window` - Time window selected for initiating full backup for the database system. There are twelve available two-hour time windows. If no option is selected, the value is null and a start time between 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the region of the database is automatically chosen. For example, if the user selects SLOT_TWO from the enum list, the automatic backup job will start in between 2:00 AM (inclusive) to 4:00 AM (exclusive).  Example: `SLOT_TWO` 
	* `backup_deletion_policy` - This defines when the backups will be deleted. - IMMEDIATE option keep the backup for predefined time i.e 72 hours and then delete permanently... - RETAIN will keep the backups as per the policy defined for database backups.
	* `backup_destination_details` - Backup destination details.
		* `dbrs_policy_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DBRS policy used for backup.

	* `recovery_window_in_days` - Number of days between the current and the earliest point of recoverability covered by automatic backups. This value applies to automatic backups only. After a new automatic backup has been created, Oracle removes old automatic backups that are created before the window. When the value is updated, it is applied to all existing automatic backups. 
	* `run_immediate_full_backup` - If set to true, configures automatic full backups in the local region (the region of the DB system) for the first backup run immediately.
* `db_home_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Database Home.
* `db_name` - The database name.

* `db_unique_name` - A system-generated name for the database to ensure uniqueness within an Oracle Data Guard group (a primary database and its standby databases). The unique name cannot be changed. 
* `db_workload` - **Deprecated.** The dbWorkload field has been deprecated for Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure, Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer, and Base Database Service. Support for this attribute will end in November 2023. You may choose to update your custom scripts to exclude the dbWorkload attribute. After November 2023 if you pass a value to the dbWorkload attribute, it will be ignored.

If none is specified, the current key version (latest) of the Key Id is used for the operation. Autonomous Database Serverless does not use key versions, hence is not applicable for Autonomous Database Serverless instances.
