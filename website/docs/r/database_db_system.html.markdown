  Provides the Db System resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service

# oci_database_db_system
This resource provides the Db System resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Creates a new DB system in the specified compartment and availability domain. The Oracle
Database edition that you specify applies to all the databases on that DB system. The selected edition cannot be changed.

An initial database is created on the DB system based on the request parameters you provide and some default
options. For detailed information about default options, see [Bare metal and virtual machine DB system default options.](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Tasks/creatingDBsystem.htm#Default)

**Note:** Deprecated for Exadata Cloud Service systems. Use the [new resource model APIs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/exaflexsystem.htm#exaflexsystem_topic-resource_model) instead.

For Exadata Cloud Service instances, support for this API will end on May 15th, 2021. See [Switching an Exadata DB System to the New Resource Model and APIs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/exaflexsystem_topic-resource_model_conversion.htm) for details on converting existing Exadata DB systems to the new resource model.

Use the [CreateCloudExadataInfrastructure](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/database/latest/CloudExadataInfrastructure/CreateCloudExadataInfrastructure/) and [CreateCloudVmCluster](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/database/latest/CloudVmCluster/CreateCloudVmCluster/) APIs to provision a new Exadata Cloud Service instance.

**Important:** When `auto_backup_enabled` is not present in the configuration or set to true, the `auto_backup_window` and `auto_full_backup_window` will be ignored

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_domain` - (Required) The availability domain where the DB system is located.
* `backup_network_nsg_ids` - (Optional) (Updatable) A list of the [OCIDs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network security groups (NSGs) that the backup network of this DB system belongs to. Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see [Security Rules](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm). Applicable only to Exadata systems. 
* `backup_subnet_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup network subnet the DB system is associated with. Applicable only to Exadata DB systems.

	**Subnet Restrictions:** See the subnet restrictions information for **subnetId**. 
* `cluster_name` - (Optional) The cluster name for Exadata and 2-node RAC virtual machine DB systems. The cluster name must begin with an alphabetic character, and may contain hyphens (-). Underscores (_) are not permitted. The cluster name can be no longer than 11 characters and is not case sensitive. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment the DB system  belongs in.
* `cpu_core_count` - (Optional) (Updatable) The number of CPU cores to enable for a bare metal or Exadata DB system or AMD VMDB Systems. The valid values depend on the specified shape:
	* BM.DenseIO1.36 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 2 to 36.
	* BM.DenseIO2.52 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 2 to 52.
	* Exadata.Base.48 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 0 to 48.
	* Exadata.Quarter1.84 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 22 to 84.
	* Exadata.Half1.168 - Specify a multiple of 4, from 44 to 168.
	* Exadata.Full1.336 - Specify a multiple of 8, from 88 to 336.
	* Exadata.Quarter2.92 - Specify a multiple of 2, from 0 to 92.
	* Exadata.Half2.184 - Specify a multiple of 4, from 0 to 184.
	* Exadata.Full2.368 - Specify a multiple of 8, from 0 to 368.
	* VM.Standard.E4.Flex - Specify any thing from 1 to 64.

	This parameter is not used for INTEL virtual machine DB systems because virtual machine DB systems have a set number of cores for each shape. For information about the number of cores for a virtual machine DB system shape, see [Virtual Machine DB Systems](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Concepts/overview.htm#virtualmachine) 
* `data_collection_options` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates user preferences for the various diagnostic collection options for the VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster/VMBM DBCS. 
	* `is_diagnostics_events_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates whether diagnostic collection is enabled for the VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster/VMBM DBCS. Enabling diagnostic collection allows you to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues. Diagnostic collection also allows Oracle to provide enhanced service and proactive support for your Exadata system. You can enable diagnostic collection during VM cluster/Cloud VM cluster provisioning. You can also disable or enable it at any time using the `UpdateVmCluster` or `updateCloudVmCluster` API. 
	* `is_health_monitoring_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates whether health monitoring is enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling health monitoring allows Oracle to collect diagnostic data and share it with its operations and support personnel. You may also receive notifications for some events. Collecting health diagnostics enables Oracle to provide proactive support and enhanced service for your system. Optionally enable health monitoring while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable health monitoring anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `UpdateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
	* `is_incident_logs_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates whether incident logs and trace collection are enabled for the VM cluster / Cloud VM cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling incident logs collection allows Oracle to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues, collect incident logs and traces, and use them to diagnose issues and resolve them. Optionally enable incident logs collection while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable incident logs collection anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `updateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. 
* `data_storage_percentage` - (Optional) The percentage assigned to DATA storage (user data and database files). The remaining percentage is assigned to RECO storage (database redo logs, archive logs, and recovery manager backups). Specify 80 or 40. The default is 80 percent assigned to DATA storage. Not applicable for virtual machine DB systems. Required for BMDBs.
* `data_storage_size_in_gb` - (Optional) (Updatable) Size (in GB) of the initial data volume that will be created and attached to a virtual machine DB system. You can scale up storage after provisioning, as needed. Note that the total storage size attached will be more than the amount you specify to allow for REDO/RECO space and software volume. Required for VMDBs.
* `database_edition` - (Required when source=DATABASE | DB_BACKUP | NONE) The Oracle Database Edition that applies to all the databases on the DB system. Exadata DB systems and 2-node RAC DB systems require ENTERPRISE_EDITION_EXTREME_PERFORMANCE. 
* `db_home` - (Required) (Updatable) Details for creating a Database Home if you are creating a database by restoring from a database backup.

	**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:

	* `update` - (Defaults to 2 hours), when updating the Db System

## Import

DbSystems can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_database_db_system.test_db_system "id"
```

Import is only supported for source=NONE

`db_home.0.database.0.admin_password` is not returned by the service for security reasons. To avoid a force new of the db_home on the next apply, add the following to the resource:

```
    lifecycle {
        ignore_changes = ["db_home.0.database.0.admin_password"]
    }
```
You may also need to add `hostname` to the ignore_changes list if you see a diff on a subsequent apply

If the oci_database_db_system being imported is missing a primary db_home, an empty placeholder for `db_home` will be set in the Terraform state.
To keep configurations consistent with the imported state, add an empty placeholder for `db_home` to your configuration like this:

```
  # Add this placeholder into your oci_database_db_system configuration to indicate that the primary db home is empty.
  db_home {
    database {
      admin_password = ""
    }
  }
```
