    * `is_monthly_patching_enabled` - If true, enables the monthly patching option.
    * `lead_time_in_weeks` - Lead time window allows user to set a lead time to prepare for a down time. The lead time is in weeks and valid value is between 1 to 4. 
    * `months` - Months during the year when maintenance should be performed.
        * `name` - Name of the month of the year.
    * `patching_mode` - Cloud Exadata infrastructure node patching method, either "ROLLING" or "NONROLLING". Default value is ROLLING.

	* `preference` - The maintenance window scheduling preference.
	* `weeks_of_month` - Weeks during the month when maintenance should be performed. Weeks start on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd days of the month, and have a duration of 7 days. Weeks start and end based on calendar dates, not days of the week. For example, to allow maintenance during the 2nd week of the month (from the 8th day to the 14th day of the month), use the value 2. Maintenance cannot be scheduled for the fifth week of months that contain more than 28 days. Note that this parameter works in conjunction with the  daysOfWeek and hoursOfDay parameters to allow you to specify specific days of the week and hours that maintenance will be performed. 
* `memory_per_oracle_compute_unit_in_gbs` - The amount of memory (in GBs) enabled per ECPU or OCPU in the Autonomous VM Cluster.
* `net_services_architecture` - Enabling SHARED server architecture enables a database server to allow many client processes to share very few server processes, thereby increasing the number of supported users.
* `next_maintenance_run_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the next maintenance run.
* `patch_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last patch applied on the system.
* `patch_model` - Database patch model preference.
* `provisionable_cpus` - An array of CPU values that can be used to successfully provision a single Autonomous Database. 
* `provisioned_cpus` - The number of CPUs provisioned in an Autonomous Container Database.
<<<<<<< ours
* `reclaimable_cpus` - CPUs that continue to be included in the count of CPUs available to the Autonomous Container Database even after one of its Autonomous Database is terminated or scaled down. You can release them to the available CPUs at its parent Autonomous VM Cluster level by restarting the Autonomous Container Database. 
* `recovery_appliance_details` - Information about the recovery appliance configuration associated with the Autonomous Container Database.
	* `allocated_storage_size_in_gbs` - The storage size of the backup destination allocated for an Autonomous Container Database to store backups on the recovery appliance, in GBs, rounded to the nearest integer.
	* `recovery_window_in_days` - Number of days between the current and earliest point of recoverability covered by automatic backups.
	* `time_recovery_appliance_details_updated` - The time when the recovery appliance details are updated.
=======
* `reclaimable_cpus` - For Autonomous Databases on Dedicated Exadata Infrastructure:
    * These are the CPUs that continue to be included in the count of CPUs available to the Autonomous Container Database even after one of its Autonomous Database is terminated or scaled down. You can release them to the available CPUs at its parent Autonomous VM Cluster level by restarting the Autonomous Container Database.
    * The CPU type (OCPUs or ECPUs) is determined by the parent Autonomous Exadata VM Cluster's compute model.
>>>>>>> theirs
* `reserved_cpus` - The number of CPUs reserved in an Autonomous Container Database.
    * These are the CPUs that continue to be included in the count of CPUs available to the Autonomous Container Database even after one of its Autonomous Database is terminated or scaled down. You can release them to the available CPUs at its parent Autonomous VM Cluster level by restarting the Autonomous Container Database. 
    * The CPU type (OCPUs or ECPUs) is determined by the parent Autonomous Exadata VM Cluster's compute model. See [Compute Models in Autonomous Database on Dedicated Exadata Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/autonomous-database/dedicated/adbak) for more details.
* `resource_pool_leader_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The unique identifier for leader autonomous database OCID [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `resource_pool_summary` - (Optional) (Updatable) The configuration details for resource pool
  * `is_disabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates if the resource pool should be deleted for the Autonomous Database.
  * `pool_size` - (Optional) (Updatable) Resource pool size.
* `role` - The Data Guard role of the Autonomous Container Database or Autonomous Database, if Autonomous Data Guard is enabled. 
* `service_level_agreement_type` - The service level agreement type of the container database. The default is STANDARD.
* `standby_maintenance_buffer_in_days` - The scheduling detail for the quarterly maintenance window of the standby Autonomous Container Database. This value represents the number of days before scheduled maintenance of the primary database. 
* `state` - The current state of the Autonomous Container Database.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 12 hours), when creating the Autonomous Container Database
	* `update` - (Defaults to 12 hours), when updating the Autonomous Container Database
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 12 hours), when destroying the Autonomous Container Database


## Import

AutonomousContainerDatabases can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
