# oci_adm_vulnerability_audit
This resource provides the Vulnerability Audit resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Adm service.

Creates a new Vulnerability Audit by providing a tree of Application Dependencies.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_adm_vulnerability_audit" "test_vulnerability_audit" {
	#Required
	build_type = var.vulnerability_audit_build_type
	knowledge_base_id = oci_adm_knowledge_base.test_knowledge_base.id

	#Optional
	application_dependencies {
		#Required
		gav = var.vulnerability_audit_application_dependencies_gav
		node_id = oci_adm_node.test_node.id

		#Optional
		application_dependency_node_ids = var.vulnerability_audit_application_dependencies_application_dependency_node_ids
	}
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	configuration {

		#Optional
		exclusions = var.vulnerability_audit_configuration_exclusions
		max_permissible_cvss_v2score = var.vulnerability_audit_configuration_max_permissible_cvss_v2score
		max_permissible_cvss_v3score = var.vulnerability_audit_configuration_max_permissible_cvss_v3score
	}
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	display_name = var.vulnerability_audit_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
	source {
		#Required
		type = var.vulnerability_audit_source_type

		#Optional
		description = var.vulnerability_audit_source_description
		oci_resource_id = oci_adm_oci_resource.test_oci_resource.id
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `application_dependencies` - (Optional) List of application dependencies (without vulnerabilities).
	* `application_dependency_node_ids` - (Optional) List of application dependencies on which this application dependency depends, each identified by its nodeId.
	* `gav` - (Required) Group Artifact Version (GAV) identifier (Group:Artifact:Version), e.g. org.graalvm.nativeimage:svm:21.1.0.
	* `node_id` - (Required) Unique identifier of an application dependency, for example nodeId1. The nodeId can be generated by assigning a unique id to each application dependency in the tree of application dependencies. Every node, even those who share the same GAV, should have a different nodeId. The preferred way of constructing a nodeId is to assign incremental integers during a breadth first or depth first search. A nodeId can be reused only it refers to the same subtree of application dependencies. (This is not equivalent to referring to the same GAV, that is, a GAV can have multiple transitive dependencies.) 
* `build_type` - (Required) The type of the build tool.
* `compartment_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The compartment Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the vulnerability audit.  If compartment identifier is not provided the compartment of the associated knowledge base will be used instead. 
* `configuration` - (Optional) Configuration for a vulnerability audit. A vulnerable application dependency is ignored if its name does match any of the items in `exclusions`, or all of the associated Vulnerabilies have a CVSS v2 score below `maxPermissibleCvssV2Score` and a CVSS v3 score below `maxPermissibleCvssV3Score`. type: object 
	* `exclusions` - (Optional) A vulnerable application dependency is ignored if its name matches any of the items in `exclusions`. An asterisk (*) in the dependency pattern acts as a wildcard and matches zero or more characters. 
	* `max_permissible_cvss_v2score` - (Optional) A vulnerable application dependency is ignored if the score of its associated Vulnerability is below maxPermissibleCvssV2Score and below maxPermissibleCvssV3Score.
	* `max_permissible_cvss_v3score` - (Optional) A vulnerable application dependency is ignored if the score of its associated Vulnerability is below maxPermissibleCvssV2Score and below maxPermissibleCvssV3Score.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The name of the vulnerability audit.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `knowledge_base_id` - (Required) The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the knowledge base.
* `source` - (Optional) vulnerability audit source.
	* `description` - (Applicable when type=EXTERNAL_RESOURCE) Description of the external resource source.
	* `oci_resource_id` - (Required when type=OCI_RESOURCE) The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource that triggered the vulnerability audit.
	* `type` - (Required) Source type of the vulnerability audit.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Vulnerability Audit
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Vulnerability Audit
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Vulnerability Audit


## Import

VulnerabilityAudits can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_adm_vulnerability_audit.test_vulnerability_audit "id"
