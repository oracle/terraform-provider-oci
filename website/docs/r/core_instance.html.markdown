# oci_core_instance
This resource provides the Instance resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Creates a new instance in the specified compartment and the specified availability domain.
For general information about instances, see
[Overview of the Compute Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm).

For information about access control and compartments, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).

For information about availability domains, see
[Regions and Availability Domains](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm).
To get a list of availability domains, use the `ListAvailabilityDomains` operation
in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an Oracle-assigned,
unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).
When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can
also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation
on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.

To launch an instance using an image or a boot volume use the `sourceDetails` parameter in [LaunchInstanceDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/LaunchInstanceDetails).

When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual
network interface card (VNIC), called the *primary VNIC*. The VNIC
has a private IP address from the subnet's CIDR. You can either assign a
private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one.
You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the
addresses, use the [ListVnicAttachments](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/VnicAttachment/ListVnicAttachments)
operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call
[GetVnic](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vnic/GetVnic) with the VNIC ID.

You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more information, see
[Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm).

To launch an instance from a Marketplace image listing, you must provide the image ID of the
listing resource version that you want, but you also must subscribe to the listing before you try
to launch the instance. To subscribe to the listing, use the [GetAppCatalogListingAgreements](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements/GetAppCatalogListingAgreements)
operation to get the signature for the terms of use agreement for the desired listing resource version.
Then, call [CreateAppCatalogSubscription](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogSubscription/CreateAppCatalogSubscription)
with the signature. To get the image ID for the LaunchInstance operation, call
[GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersion/GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion).

When launching an instance, you may provide the `securityAttributes` parameter in
[LaunchInstanceDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/LaunchInstanceDetails) to manage security attributes via the instance, 
or in the embedded [CreateVnicDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/CreateVnicDetails/) to manage security attributes
via the VNIC directly, but not both.  Providing `securityAttributes` in both locations will return a
400 Bad Request response.

To determine whether capacity is available for a specific shape before you create an instance,
use the [CreateComputeCapacityReport](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/ComputeCapacityReport/CreateComputeCapacityReport)
operation.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `async` - (Optional) Whether Terraform creates and destroys the resource asynchronously. The default value is false.
	* If `async` is true, all the creation and deletion of instances are asynchronous
	* If `async` is false, all the creation and deletion of instances are synchronous as normal behavior

-> Please follow this guideline [Terraform support asynchronous operation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/terraform-async.htm) for more detail of this advanced option.

* `agent_config` - (Optional) (Updatable) Configuration options for the Oracle Cloud Agent software running on the instance.
	* `are_all_plugins_disabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether Oracle Cloud Agent can run all the available plugins. This includes the management and monitoring plugins.

		To get a list of available plugins, use the [ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/instanceagent/20180530/Plugin/ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins) operation in the Oracle Cloud Agent API. For more information about the available plugins, see [Managing Plugins with Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm). 
	* `is_management_disabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether Oracle Cloud Agent can run all the available management plugins. Default value is false (management plugins are enabled).

		These are the management plugins: OS Management Service Agent and Compute Instance Run Command.

		The management plugins are controlled by this parameter and by the per-plugin configuration in the `pluginsConfig` object.
		* If `isManagementDisabled` is true, all of the management plugins are disabled, regardless of the per-plugin configuration.
		* If `isManagementDisabled` is false, all of the management plugins are enabled. You can optionally disable individual management plugins by providing a value in the `pluginsConfig` object. 
	* `is_monitoring_disabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether Oracle Cloud Agent can gather performance metrics and monitor the instance using the monitoring plugins. Default value is false (monitoring plugins are enabled).

		These are the monitoring plugins: Compute Instance Monitoring and Custom Logs Monitoring.

		The monitoring plugins are controlled by this parameter and by the per-plugin configuration in the `pluginsConfig` object.
		* If `isMonitoringDisabled` is true, all of the monitoring plugins are disabled, regardless of the per-plugin configuration.
		* If `isMonitoringDisabled` is false, all of the monitoring plugins are enabled. You can optionally disable individual monitoring plugins by providing a value in the `pluginsConfig` object. 
	* `plugins_config` - (Optional) (Updatable) The configuration of plugins associated with this instance.
		* `desired_state` - (Required) (Updatable) Whether the plugin should be enabled or disabled.

			To enable the monitoring and management plugins, the `isMonitoringDisabled` and `isManagementDisabled` attributes must also be set to false. 
		* `name` - (Required) (Updatable) The plugin name. To get a list of available plugins, use the [ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/instanceagent/20180530/Plugin/ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins) operation in the Oracle Cloud Agent API. For more information about the available plugins, see [Managing Plugins with Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm). 
* `availability_config` - (Optional) (Updatable) Options for VM migration during infrastructure maintenance events and for defining the availability of a VM instance after a maintenance event that impacts the underlying hardware. 
	* `is_live_migration_preferred` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether to live migrate supported VM instances to a healthy physical VM host without disrupting running instances during infrastructure maintenance events. If null, Oracle chooses the best option for migrating the VM during infrastructure maintenance events. 
	* `recovery_action` - (Optional) (Updatable) The lifecycle state for an instance when it is recovered after infrastructure maintenance.
		* `RESTORE_INSTANCE` - The instance is restored to the lifecycle state it was in before the maintenance event. If the instance was running, it is automatically rebooted. This is the default action when a value is not set.
		* `STOP_INSTANCE` - The instance is recovered in the stopped state. 
* `availability_domain` - (Required) The availability domain of the instance.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1`
* `capacity_reservation_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The OCID of the compute capacity reservation this instance is launched under. You can opt out of all default reservations by specifying an empty string as input for this field. For more information, see [Capacity Reservations](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/reserve-capacity.htm#default). 
* `cluster_placement_group_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the cluster placement group of the instance.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment.
* `compute_cluster_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the [compute cluster](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/compute-clusters.htm) that the instance will be created in. 
* `create_vnic_details` - (Optional) (Updatable) Contains properties for a VNIC. You use this object when creating the primary VNIC during instance launch or when creating a secondary VNIC. For more information about VNICs, see [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm). 
	* `assign_ipv6ip` - (Optional) Whether to allocate an IPv6 address at instance and VNIC creation from an IPv6 enabled subnet. Default: False. When provided you may optionally provide an IPv6 prefix (`ipv6SubnetCidr`) of your choice to assign the IPv6 address from. If `ipv6SubnetCidr` is not provided then an IPv6 prefix is chosen for you. 
	* `assign_private_dns_record` - (Optional) Whether the VNIC should be assigned a DNS record. If set to false, there will be no DNS record registration for the VNIC. If set to true, the DNS record will be registered. The default value is true.
		If you specify a `hostnameLabel`, the `assignPrivateDnsRecord` is require to be set to true. 
	* `assign_public_ip` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether the VNIC should be assigned a public IP address. Defaults to whether the subnet is public or private. If not set and the VNIC is being created in a private subnet (that is, where `prohibitPublicIpOnVnic` = true in the [Subnet](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Subnet/)), then no public IP address is assigned. If not set and the subnet is public (`prohibitPublicIpOnVnic` = false), then a public IP address is assigned. If set to true and `prohibitPublicIpOnVnic` = true, an error is returned.

		**Note:** This public IP address is associated with the primary private IP on the VNIC. For more information, see [IP Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm).

		**Note:** There's a limit to the number of [public IPs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PublicIp/) a VNIC or instance can have. If you try to create a secondary VNIC with an assigned public IP for an instance that has already reached its public IP limit, an error is returned. For information about the public IP limits, see [Public IP Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm).

		Example: `false`

		If you specify a `vlanId`, then `assignPublicIp` must be set to false. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan). 
	* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
	* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
	* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
	* `hostname_label` - (Optional) (Updatable) The hostname for the VNIC's primary private IP. Used for DNS. The value is the hostname portion of the primary private IP's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (for example, `bminstance1` in FQDN `bminstance1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com`). Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet and comply with [RFC 952](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952) and [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123). The value appears in the `[Vnic](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vnic/)` object and also the `[PrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/)` object returned by `[ListPrivateIps](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/ListPrivateIps)` and `[GetPrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/GetPrivateIp)`.

		For more information, see [DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm).

		When launching an instance, use this `hostnameLabel` instead of the deprecated `hostnameLabel` in `[LaunchInstanceDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/LaunchInstanceDetails)`. If you provide both, the values must match.

		Example: `bminstance1`

		If you specify a `vlanId`, the `hostnameLabel` cannot be specified. VNICs on a VLAN can not be assigned a hostname. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan). 
	* `ipv6address_ipv6subnet_cidr_pair_details` - (Optional) A list of IPv6 prefix ranges from which the VNIC should be assigned an IPv6 address. You can provide only the prefix ranges from which Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will select an available address from the range. You can optionally choose to leave the prefix range empty and instead provide the specific IPv6 address that should be used from within that range. 
	* `nsg_ids` - (Optional) (Updatable) A list of the OCIDs of the network security groups (NSGs) to add the VNIC to. For more information about NSGs, see [NetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/NetworkSecurityGroup/).

		If a `vlanId` is specified, the `nsgIds` cannot be specified. The `vlanId` indicates that the VNIC will belong to a VLAN instead of a subnet. With VLANs, all VNICs in the VLAN belong to the NSGs that are associated with the VLAN. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan). 
	* `private_ip` - (Optional) A private IP address of your choice to assign to the VNIC. Must be an available IP address within the subnet's CIDR. If you don't specify a value, Oracle automatically assigns a private IP address from the subnet. This is the VNIC's *primary* private IP address. The value appears in the `[Vnic](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vnic/)` object and also the `[PrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/)` object returned by `[ListPrivateIps](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/ListPrivateIps)` and `[GetPrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/GetPrivateIp)`.

		 If you specify a `vlanId`, the `privateIp` cannot be specified. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan).

		Example: `10.0.3.3` 

	* `security_attributes` - (Optional) Security Attributes for this resource. This is unique to ZPR, and helps identify which resources are allowed to be accessed by what permission controls.  Example: `{"Oracle-DataSecurity-ZPR.MaxEgressCount.value": "42", "Oracle-DataSecurity-ZPR.MaxEgressCount.mode": "audit"}` 

	* `skip_source_dest_check` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether the source/destination check is disabled on the VNIC. Defaults to `false`, which means the check is performed. For information about why you would skip the source/destination check, see [Using a Private IP as a Route Target](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm#privateip).

		 If you specify a `vlanId`, the `skipSourceDestCheck` cannot be specified because the source/destination check is always disabled for VNICs in a VLAN. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan).

		Example: `true` 
	* `subnet_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet to create the VNIC in. When launching an instance, use this `subnetId` instead of the deprecated `subnetId` in [LaunchInstanceDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/LaunchInstanceDetails). At least one of them is required; if you provide both, the values must match.

		If you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer and creating a secondary VNIC in a VLAN instead of a subnet, provide a `vlanId` instead of a `subnetId`. If you provide both a `vlanId` and `subnetId`, the request fails. 
	* `vlan_id` - (Optional) Provide this attribute only if you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer and creating a secondary VNIC in a VLAN. The value is the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VLAN. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan).

		Provide a `vlanId` instead of a `subnetId`. If you provide both a `vlanId` and `subnetId`, the request fails. 
* `dedicated_vm_host_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The OCID of the dedicated virtual machine host to place the instance on. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `extended_metadata` - (Optional) (Updatable) Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide. They serve the same purpose and functionality as fields in the `metadata` object.

	They are distinguished from `metadata` fields in that these can be nested JSON objects (whereas `metadata` fields are string/string maps only).

	The combined size of the `metadata` and `extendedMetadata` objects can be a maximum of 32,000 bytes. 

	Input in terraform is the same as metadata but allows nested metadata if you pass a valid JSON string as a value. See the example above.
* `fault_domain` - (Optional) (Updatable) A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.

	If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for you.

	 To get a list of fault domains, use the [ListFaultDomains](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains) operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

	Example: `FAULT-DOMAIN-1` 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `hostname_label` - (Optional) Deprecated. Instead use `hostnameLabel` in [CreateVnicDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/CreateVnicDetails/). If you provide both, the values must match. 
* `image` - (Optional) Deprecated. Use `sourceDetails` with [InstanceSourceViaImageDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/InstanceSourceViaImageDetails) source type instead. If you specify values for both, the values must match. 
* `instance_configuration_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the Instance Configuration containing instance launch details. Any other fields supplied in this instance launch request will override the details stored in the Instance Configuration for this instance launch.
* `instance_options` - (Optional) (Updatable) Optional mutable instance options
	* `are_legacy_imds_endpoints_disabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether to disable the legacy (/v1) instance metadata service endpoints. Customers who have migrated to /v2 should set this to true for added security. Default is false. 
* `ipxe_script` - (Optional) This is an advanced option.

	When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.

	If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots. Be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots, not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.

	The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

	If your instance boot volume attachment type is paravirtualized, the boot volume is attached to the instance through virtio-scsi and no iPXE script is used. If your instance boot volume attachment type is paravirtualized and you use custom iPXE to network boot into your instance, the primary boot volume is attached as a data volume through virtio-scsi drive.

	A metadata service runs on every launched instance. The service is an HTTP endpoint listening on 169.254.169.254. You can use the service to:
	* Provide information to [Cloud-Init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to be used for various system initialization tasks.
	* Get information about the instance, including the custom metadata that you provide when you launch the instance.

	**Providing Cloud-Init Metadata**

	You can use the following metadata key names to provide information to Cloud-Init:

	**"ssh_authorized_keys"** - Provide one or more public SSH keys to be included in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the default user on the instance. Use a newline character to separate multiple keys. The SSH keys must be in the format necessary for the `authorized_keys` file, as shown in the example below.

	**"user_data"** - Provide your own base64-encoded data to be used by Cloud-Init to run custom scripts or provide custom Cloud-Init configuration. For information about how to take advantage of user data, see the [Cloud-Init Documentation](http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/format.html).

	**Metadata Example**

	```
	"metadata" : { "quake_bot_level" : "Severe", "ssh_authorized_keys" : "ssh-rsa <your_public_SSH_key>== rsa-key-20160227", "user_data" : "<your_public_SSH_key>==" }
	```

	**Getting Metadata on the Instance**

	To get information about your instance, connect to the instance using SSH and issue any of the following GET requests:

	```
	curl -H "Authorization: Bearer Oracle" http://169.254.169.254/opc/v2/instance/
	curl -H "Authorization: Bearer Oracle" http://169.254.169.254/opc/v2/instance/metadata/
	curl -H "Authorization: Bearer Oracle" http://169.254.169.254/opc/v2/instance/metadata/<any-key-name>
	```

	You'll get back a response that includes all the instance information; only the metadata information; or the metadata information for the specified key name, respectively.

	The combined size of the `metadata` and `extendedMetadata` objects can be a maximum of 32,000 bytes.
	
	**Note:** Both the 'user_data' and 'ssh_authorized_keys' fields cannot be changed after an instance has launched. Any request which updates, removes, or adds either of these fields will be rejected. You must provide the same values for 'user_data' and 'ssh_authorized_keys' that already exist on the instance.
* `platform_config` - (Optional) (Updatable only for VM's) The platform configuration requested for the instance.

	If you provide the parameter, the instance is created with the platform configuration that you specify. For any values that you omit, the instance uses the default configuration values for the `shape` that you specify. If you don't provide the parameter, the default values for the `shape` are used.

	Each shape only supports certain configurable values. If the values that you provide are not valid for the specified `shape`, an error is returned.

	For more information about shielded instances, see [Shielded Instances](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/shielded-instances.htm).

Value must be a multiple of 25%. If the requested percentage results in a fractional number of cores, the system rounds up the number of cores across processors and provisions an instance with a whole number of cores.

		If the applications that you run on the instance use a core-based licensing model and need fewer cores than the full size of the shape, you can disable cores to reduce your licensing costs. The instance itself is billed for the full shape, regardless of whether all cores are enabled.

* `shape_config` - (Optional) (Updatable) The shape configuration requested for the instance.

	If the parameter is provided, the instance is created with the resources that you specify. If some properties are missing or the entire parameter is not provided, the instance is created with the default configuration values for the `shape` that you specify.

	Each shape only supports certain configurable values. If the values that you provide are not valid for the specified `shape`, an error is returned. 
	* `baseline_ocpu_utilization` - (Optional) (Updatable) The baseline OCPU utilization for a subcore burstable VM instance. Leave this attribute blank for a non-burstable instance, or explicitly specify non-burstable with `BASELINE_1_1`.

	* `is_monitoring_disabled` - Whether Oracle Cloud Agent can gather performance metrics and monitor the instance using the monitoring plugins.

		These are the monitoring plugins: Compute Instance Monitoring and Custom Logs Monitoring.

		The monitoring plugins are controlled by this parameter and by the per-plugin configuration in the `pluginsConfig` object.
		* If `isMonitoringDisabled` is true, all of the monitoring plugins are disabled, regardless of the per-plugin configuration.
		* If `isMonitoringDisabled` is false, all of the monitoring plugins are enabled. You can optionally disable individual monitoring plugins by providing a value in the `pluginsConfig` object. 
	* `plugins_config` - The configuration of plugins associated with this instance.
		* `desired_state` - Whether the plugin should be enabled or disabled.

			To enable the monitoring and management plugins, the `isMonitoringDisabled` and `isManagementDisabled` attributes must also be set to false. 
		* `name` - The plugin name. To get a list of available plugins, use the [ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/instanceagent/20180530/Plugin/ListInstanceagentAvailablePlugins) operation in the Oracle Cloud Agent API. For more information about the available plugins, see [Managing Plugins with Oracle Cloud Agent](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/manage-plugins.htm). 
* `availability_config` - Options for defining the availabiity of a VM instance after a maintenance event that impacts the underlying hardware. 
	* `is_live_migration_preferred` - Whether to live migrate supported VM instances to a healthy physical VM host without disrupting running instances during infrastructure maintenance events. If null, Oracle chooses the best option for migrating the VM during infrastructure maintenance events. 
	* `recovery_action` - The lifecycle state for an instance when it is recovered after infrastructure maintenance.
		* `RESTORE_INSTANCE` - The instance is restored to the lifecycle state it was in before the maintenance event. If the instance was running, it is automatically rebooted. This is the default action when a value is not set.
		* `STOP_INSTANCE` - The instance is recovered in the stopped state. 
* `availability_domain` - The availability domain the instance is running in.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1`
* `capacity_reservation_id` - The OCID of the compute capacity reservation this instance is launched under. When this field contains an empty string or is null, the instance is not currently in a capacity reservation. For more information, see [Capacity Reservations](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/reserve-capacity.htm#default).
* `boot_volume_id` - The OCID of the attached boot volume. If the `source_type` is `bootVolume`, this will be the same OCID as the `source_id`.
* `capacity_reservation_id` - The OCID of the compute capacity reservation this instance is launched under. When this field contains an empty string or is null, the instance is not currently in a capacity reservation. For more information, see [Capacity Reservations](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/reserve-capacity.htm#default).
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the instance.
* `dedicated_vm_host_id` - The OCID of the dedicated virtual machine host that the instance is placed on. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `extended_metadata` - Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide. They serve the same purpose and functionality as fields in the `metadata` object.

	They are distinguished from `metadata` fields in that these can be nested JSON objects (whereas `metadata` fields are string/string maps only). 

	Input in terraform is the same as metadata but allows nested metadata if you pass a valid JSON string as a value. See the example below.
* `fault_domain` - The name of the fault domain the instance is running in.

	A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.

	If you do not specify the fault domain, the system selects one for you.

	Example: `FAULT-DOMAIN-1` 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the instance.
* `image` - Deprecated. Use `sourceDetails` instead. 
* `instance_configuration_id` - The OCID of the Instance Configuration used to source launch details for this instance. Any other fields supplied in the instance launch request override the details stored in the Instance Configuration for this instance launch.
* `instance_options` - Optional mutable instance options
	* `are_legacy_imds_endpoints_disabled` - Whether to disable the legacy (/v1) instance metadata service endpoints. Customers who have migrated to /v2 should set this to true for added security. Default is false. 
* `ipxe_script` - When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.

	If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots. Be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots, not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.

	The default iPXE script connects to the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network-boot from the instance's local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015-02.oracle.boot.

	If your instance boot volume attachment type is paravirtualized, the boot volume is attached to the instance through virtio-scsi and no iPXE script is used. If your instance boot volume attachment type is paravirtualized and you use custom iPXE to network boot into your instance, the primary boot volume is attached as a data volume through virtio-scsi drive.

	For more information about the Bring Your Own Image feature of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, see [Bring Your Own Image](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/bringyourownimage.htm).
