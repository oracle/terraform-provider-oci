  Provides the File System resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage service

# oci_file_storage_file_system
This resource provides the File System resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure File Storage service.

Creates a new file system in the specified compartment and
availability domain. Instances can mount file systems in
another availability domain, but doing so might increase
latency when compared to mounting instances in the same
availability domain.

After you create a file system, you can associate it with a mount
target. Instances can then mount the file system by connecting to the
mount target's IP address. You can associate a file system with
more than one mount target at a time.

For information about access control and compartments, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).

For information about Network Security Groups access control, see
[Network Security Groups](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm).

For information about availability domains, see [Regions and
Availability Domains](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm).
To get a list of availability domains, use the
`ListAvailabilityDomains` operation in the Identity and Access
Management Service API.

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including
file systems, get an Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle
Cloud Identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)).
When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response.
You can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API operation on that resource
type or by viewing the resource in the Console.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `are_quota_rules_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies the enforcement of quota rules on the file system.
* `availability_domain` - (Required) The availability domain to create the file system in.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `clone_attach_status` - (Optional) Specifies whether the clone file system is attached to its parent file system. If the value is set to 'DETACH', then the file system will be created, which is deep copied from the snapshot specified by sourceSnapshotId, else will remain attached to its parent. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment to create the file system in.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. It does not have to be unique, and it is changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `My file system` 
* `filesystem_snapshot_policy_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the associated file system snapshot policy, which controls the frequency of snapshot creation and retention period of the taken snapshots.

	May be unset as a blank value. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The OCID of KMS key used to encrypt the encryption keys associated with this file system. May be unset as a blank or deleted from the configuration to remove the KMS key.
* `locks` - (Optional) Locks associated with this resource.
	* `message` - (Optional) A message added by the creator of the lock. This is typically used to give an indication of why the resource is locked. 
	* `related_resource_id` - (Optional) The ID of the resource that is locking this resource. Indicates that deleting this resource will remove the lock. 
	* `time_created` - (Optional) When the lock was created.
	* `type` - (Required) Type of the lock.
* `source_snapshot_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the snapshot used to create a cloned file system. See [Cloning a File System](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/File/Tasks/cloningFS.htm). 
* `detach_clone_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when incremented triggers Detach Clone. Could be set to any integer value.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
