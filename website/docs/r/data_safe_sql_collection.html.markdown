Creates a new SQL collection resource.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_data_safe_sql_collection" "test_sql_collection" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	db_user_name = oci_identity_user.test_user.name
	target_id = oci_cloud_guard_target.test_target.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.sql_collection_description
	display_name = var.sql_collection_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	sql_level = var.sql_collection_sql_level
	status = var.sql_collection_status
}
```
