# oci_os_management_hub_management_station
This resource provides the Management Station resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Os Management Hub service.

Creates a management station using the proxy and mirror configuration information provided.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_os_management_hub_management_station" "test_management_station" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.management_station_display_name
	hostname = var.management_station_hostname
	mirror {
		#Required
		directory = var.management_station_mirror_directory
		port = var.management_station_mirror_port
		sslport = var.management_station_mirror_sslport

		#Optional
		is_sslverify_enabled = var.management_station_mirror_is_sslverify_enabled
		sslcert = var.management_station_mirror_sslcert
	}
	proxy {
		#Required

* `mirror` - (Required) (Updatable) Information used to create the mirror configuration for a management station.
	* `directory` - (Required) (Updatable) Path to the data volume on the management station where software source mirrors are stored.
	* `is_sslverify_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) When enabled, the SSL certificate is verified whenever an instance installs or updates a package from a software source that is mirrored on the management station.
	* `port` - (Required) (Updatable) Default mirror listening port for http.
	* `sslcert` - (Optional) (Updatable) Path to the SSL cerfificate.
	* `sslport` - (Required) (Updatable) Default mirror listening port for https.
