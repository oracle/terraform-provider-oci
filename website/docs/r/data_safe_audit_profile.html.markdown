# oci_data_safe_audit_profile
This resource provides the Audit Profile resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Updates one or more attributes of the specified audit profile.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_data_safe_audit_profile" "test_audit_profile" {
	#Required
	audit_profile_id = oci_data_safe_audit_profile.test_audit_profile.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.audit_profile_description
	display_name = var.audit_profile_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	is_paid_usage_enabled = var.audit_profile_is_paid_usage_enabled
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `audit_profile_id` - (Required) The OCID of the audit.
* `compartment_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment that contains the audit.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) The description of the audit profile.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The display name of the audit profile. The name does not have to be unique, and it's updatable.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm)  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_paid_usage_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates if you want to continue collecting audit records beyond the free limit of one million audit records per month per target database, potentially incurring additional charges. The default value is inherited from the global settings.  You can change at the global level or at the target level. 
* `change_retention_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when incremented triggers Change Retention. Could be set to any integer value.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
