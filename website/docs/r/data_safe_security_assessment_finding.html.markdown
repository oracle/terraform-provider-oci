# oci_data_safe_security_assessment_finding
This resource provides the Security Assessment Finding resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.


  Patches one or more findings in the specified template baseline type security assessment. Use it to modify max allowed risk level in template baseline.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_data_safe_security_assessment_finding" "test_security_assessment_finding" {
	#Required
	security_assessment_id = oci_data_safe_security_assessment.test_security_assessment.id

	#Optional
	patch_operations {
		#Required
		operation = var.security_assessment_finding_patch_operations_operation
		selection = var.security_assessment_finding_patch_operations_selection

		#Optional
		value = var.security_assessment_finding_patch_operations_value
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `patch_operations` - (Optional) (Updatable) 
	* `operation` - (Required) (Updatable) The operation can be one of these values: `INSERT`, `MERGE`, `REMOVE`
	* `selection` - (Required) (Updatable) 
	* `value` - (Required when operation=INSERT | MERGE) (Updatable) 
* `security_assessment_id` - (Required) 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `assessment_id` - The OCID of the assessment that generated this finding.
* `category` - The category to which the finding belongs to.
* `details` - The details of the finding. Provides detailed information to explain the finding summary, typically results from the assessed database, followed by any recommendations for changes.
* `has_target_db_risk_level_changed` - Determines if this risk level has changed on the target database since the last time 'severity' was modified by user.
* `is_risk_modified` - Determines if this risk level was modified by user.
* `is_top_finding` - Indicates whether a given finding is marked as topFinding or not.
* `justification` - User provided reason for accepting or modifying this finding if they choose to do so.
* `key` - The unique finding key. This is a system-generated identifier. To get the finding key for a finding, use ListFindings.
* `lifecycle_details` - Details about the current state of the finding.
* `oneline` - Provides a recommended approach to take to remediate the finding reported.
* `oracle_defined_severity` - The severity of the finding as determined by security assessment. This cannot be modified by user.

* `state` - The current state of the finding.
* `summary` - The brief summary of the finding. When the finding is informational, the summary typically reports only the number of data elements that were examined.
* `target_id` - The OCID of the target database.
* `time_updated` - The date and time the risk level of finding was last updated, in the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). 
* `time_valid_until` - The time until which the change in severity(deferred / modified) of this finding is valid.
* `title` - The short title for the finding.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:

	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Security Assessment Finding
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Security Assessment Finding
