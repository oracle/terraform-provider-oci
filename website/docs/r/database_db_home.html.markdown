  Provides the Db Home resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service

# oci_database_db_home
This resource provides the Db Home resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Creates a new Database Home in the specified database system based on the request parameters you provide. Applies only to bare metal and Exadata systems.

**Important:** Unless `enable_database_delete` is explicitly set to true:
* Terraform will not delete the database within the Db Home configuration but rather remove it from the config and state file.
* This leads to dangling resources which are not managed via Terraform unless explicitly imported

**Important:** When `auto_backup_enabled` is not present in the configuration or set to true, the `auto_backup_window` and `auto_full_backup_window` will be ignored

		* `auto_backup_enabled` - (Applicable when source=NONE | VM_CLUSTER_NEW) (Updatable) If set to true, configures automatic backups. If you previously used RMAN or dbcli to configure backups and then you switch to using the Console or the API for backups, a new backup configuration is created and associated with your database. This means that you can no longer rely on your previously configured unmanaged backups to work.
		* `auto_backup_window` - (Applicable when source=NONE | VM_CLUSTER_NEW) (Updatable) Time window selected for initiating automatic backup for the database system. There are twelve available two-hour time windows. If no option is selected, a start time between 12:00 AM to 7:00 AM in the region of the database is automatically chosen.

		* `auto_full_backup_day` - (Applicable when source=NONE | VM_CLUSTER_NEW) Day of the week the full backup should be applied on the database system. If no option is selected, the value is null and we will default to Sunday.
		* `auto_full_backup_window` - (Applicable when source=NONE | VM_CLUSTER_NEW) Time window selected for initiating full backup for the database system.

For example, if the user selects SLOT_TWO from the enum list, the automatic backup job will start in between 2:00 AM (inclusive) to 4:00 AM (exclusive).  Example: `SLOT_TWO` 
		* `backup_deletion_policy` - (Applicable when source=NONE | VM_CLUSTER_NEW) This defines when the backups will be deleted. - IMMEDIATE option keep the backup for predefined time i.e 72 hours and then delete permanently... - RETAIN will keep the backups as per the policy defined for database backups.

* `is_unified_auditing_enabled` - Indicates whether unified autiding is enabled or not.
* `kms_key_id` - The OCID of the key container that is used as the master encryption key in database transparent data encryption (TDE) operations.
* `last_patch_history_entry_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last patch history. This value is updated as soon as a patch operation is started.
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `one_off_patches` - List of one-off patches for Database Homes.
* `state` - The current state of the Database Home.
* `time_created` - The date and time the Database Home was created.
* `vm_cluster_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM cluster.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 12 hours), when creating the Db Home
	* `update` - (Defaults to 2 hours), when updating the Db Home
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 2 hours), when destroying the Db Home


## Import

DbHomes can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_database_db_home.test_db_home "id"
```

Import is only supported for source=NONE

database.0.admin_password is not returned by the service for security reasons. Add the following to the resource:

```
    lifecycle {
        ignore_changes = ["database.0.admin_password"]
    }
```

The creation of an oci_database_db_system requires that it be created with exactly one oci_database_db_home. Therefore the first db home will have to be a property of the db system resource and any further db homes to be added to the db system will have to be added as first class resources using "oci_database_db_home".
