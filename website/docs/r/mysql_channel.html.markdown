## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the compartment.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) User provided information about the Channel.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The user-friendly name for the Channel. It does not have to be unique.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `is_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether the Channel should be enabled upon creation. If set to true, the Channel will be asynchronously started as a result of the create Channel operation. 
* `source` - (Required) (Updatable) Parameters detailing how to provision the source for the given Channel.
	* `anonymous_transactions_handling` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies how the replication channel handles replicated transactions without an identifier, enabling replication from a source that does not use transaction-id-based replication to a replica that does. 
		* `last_configured_log_filename` - (Applicable when policy=ASSIGN_MANUAL_UUID | ASSIGN_TARGET_UUID) (Updatable) Specifies one of the coordinates (file) at which the replica should begin reading the source's log. As this value specifies the point where replication starts from, it is only used once, when it starts. It is never used again, unless a new UpdateChannel operation modifies it. 
		* `last_configured_log_offset` - (Applicable when policy=ASSIGN_MANUAL_UUID | ASSIGN_TARGET_UUID) (Updatable) Specifies one of the coordinates (offset) at which the replica should begin reading the source's log. As this value specifies the point where replication starts from, it is only used once, when it starts. It is never used again, unless a new UpdateChannel operation modifies it. 
		* `policy` - (Required) (Updatable) Specifies how the replication channel handles anonymous transactions.
		* `uuid` - (Applicable when policy=ASSIGN_MANUAL_UUID) (Updatable) The UUID that is used as a prefix when generating transaction identifiers for anonymous transactions coming from the source. You can change the UUID later. 
	* `hostname` - (Required) (Updatable) The network address of the MySQL instance.
	* `password` - (Required) (Updatable) The password for the replication user. The password must be between 8 and 32 characters long, and must contain at least 1 numeric character, 1 lowercase character, 1 uppercase character, and 1 special (nonalphanumeric) character. 
	* `port` - (Optional) (Updatable) The port the source MySQL instance listens on.
	* `source_type` - (Required) (Updatable) The specific source identifier.
	* `ssl_ca_certificate` - (Optional) (Updatable) The CA certificate of the server used for VERIFY_IDENTITY and VERIFY_CA ssl modes.
		* `certificate_type` - (Required) (Updatable) The type of CA certificate.
		* `contents` - (Required) (Updatable) The string containing the CA certificate in PEM format.
	* `ssl_mode` - (Required) (Updatable) The SSL mode of the Channel.
	* `username` - (Required) (Updatable) The name of the replication user on the source MySQL instance. The username has a maximum length of 96 characters. For more information, please see the [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/change-master-to.html) 
* `target` - (Required) (Updatable) Parameters detailing how to provision the target for the given Channel.
	* `applier_username` - (Optional) (Updatable) The username for the replication applier of the target MySQL DB System.
	* `channel_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The case-insensitive name that identifies the replication channel. Channel names must follow the rules defined for [MySQL identifiers](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/identifiers.html). The names of non-Deleted Channels must be unique for each DB System. 
	* `db_system_id` - (Required) The OCID of the target DB System.
	* `delay_in_seconds` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies the amount of time, in seconds, that the channel waits before  applying a transaction received from the source. 
	* `filters` - (Optional) (Updatable) Replication filter rules to be applied at the DB System Channel target. 
		* `type` - (Required) (Updatable) The type of the filter rule.

			For details on each type, see [Replication Filtering Rules](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-rules.html) 
		* `value` - (Required) (Updatable) The body of the filter rule. This can represent a database, a table, or a database pair (represented as "db1->db2"). For more information, see [Replication Filtering Rules](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/replication-rules.html). 
	* `tables_without_primary_key_handling` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies how a replication channel handles the creation and alteration of tables  that do not have a primary key. The default value is set to ALLOW. 
	* `target_type` - (Required) (Updatable) The specific target identifier.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
