# oci_golden_gate_database_registration
This resource provides the Database Registration resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Golden Gate service.

Note: Deprecated. Use the /connections API instead.
Creates a new DatabaseRegistration.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_golden_gate_database_registration" "test_database_registration" {
	#Required
	alias_name = var.database_registration_alias_name
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.database_registration_display_name
	fqdn = var.database_registration_fqdn
	password = var.database_registration_password
	username = var.database_registration_username

	#Optional
	connection_string = var.database_registration_connection_string
	database_id = oci_database_database.test_database.id
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	description = var.database_registration_description
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
	ip_address = var.database_registration_ip_address
	key_id = oci_kms_key.test_key.id
	secret_compartment_id = oci_identity_compartment.test_compartment.id
	session_mode = var.database_registration_session_mode
	subnet_id = oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id
	vault_id = oci_kms_vault.test_vault.id
	wallet = var.database_registration_wallet
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `alias_name` - (Required) (Updatable) Credential store alias. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment being referenced. 
* `connection_string` - (Optional) (Updatable) Connect descriptor or Easy Connect Naming method used to connect to a database. 
* `database_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the database being referenced. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Tags defined for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace.  Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) Metadata about this specific object. 
* `display_name` - (Required) (Updatable) An object's Display Name. 
* `fqdn` - (Required) (Updatable) A three-label Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) for a resource. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) A simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type, or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only.  Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `ip_address` - (Optional) The private IP address in the customer's VCN of the customer's endpoint, typically a database. 
* `key_id` - (Optional) Refers to the customer's master key OCID.  If provided, it references a key to manage secrets. Customers must add policies to permit GoldenGate to use this key. 
* `password` - (Required) (Updatable) The password Oracle GoldenGate uses to connect the associated system of the given technology. It must conform to the specific security requirements including length, case sensitivity, and so on. Deprecated: This field is deprecated and replaced by "passwordSecretId". This field will be removed after February 15 2026. 
* `secret_compartment_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the compartment where the GoldenGate Secret will be created.  If provided, it references a key to manage secrets. Customers must add policies to permit GoldenGate to use this key. 
* `session_mode` - (Optional) (Updatable) The mode of the database connection session to be established by the data client. 'REDIRECT' - for a RAC database, 'DIRECT' - for a non-RAC database. Connection to a RAC database involves a redirection received from the SCAN listeners to the database node to connect to. By default the mode would be DIRECT. 
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the target subnet of the dedicated connection. 
* `username` - (Required) (Updatable) The username Oracle GoldenGate uses to connect the associated system of the given technology. This username must already exist and be available by the system/application to be connected to and must conform to the case sensitivty requirments defined in it. 
* `vault_id` - (Optional) Refers to the customer's vault OCID.  If provided, it references a vault where GoldenGate can manage secrets. Customers must add policies to permit GoldenGate to manage secrets contained within this vault. 
* `wallet` - (Optional) (Updatable) The wallet contents Oracle GoldenGate uses to make connections to a database. This attribute is expected to be base64 encoded. Deprecated: This field is deprecated and replaced by "walletSecretId". This field will be removed after February 15 2026. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
