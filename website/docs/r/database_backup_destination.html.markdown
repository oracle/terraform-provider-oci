# oci_database_backup_destination
This resource provides the Backup Destination resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Creates a backup destination in an Exadata Cloud@Customer system.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_database_backup_destination" "test_backup_destination" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.backup_destination_display_name
	type = var.backup_destination_type

	#Optional
	connection_string = var.backup_destination_connection_string
	defined_tags = var.backup_destination_defined_tags
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	local_mount_point_path = var.backup_destination_local_mount_point_path
	mount_type_details {
		#Required
		mount_type = var.backup_destination_mount_type_details_mount_type

		#Optional
		local_mount_point_path = var.backup_destination_mount_type_details_local_mount_point_path
		nfs_server = var.backup_destination_mount_type_details_nfs_server
		nfs_server_export = var.backup_destination_mount_type_details_nfs_server_export
	}
	vpc_users = var.backup_destination_vpc_users
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `connection_string` - (Required when type=RECOVERY_APPLIANCE) (Updatable) The connection string for connecting to the Recovery Appliance.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `display_name` - (Required) The user-provided name of the backup destination.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `local_mount_point_path` - (Applicable when type=NFS) (Updatable) **Deprecated.** The local directory path on each VM cluster node where the NFS server location is mounted. The local directory path and the NFS server location must each be the same across all of the VM cluster nodes. Ensure that the NFS mount is maintained continuously on all of the VM cluster nodes. This field is deprecated. Use the mountTypeDetails field instead to specify the mount type for NFS. 
* `mount_type_details` - (Applicable when type=NFS) Mount type details for backup destination.
	* `local_mount_point_path` - (Required when mount_type=SELF_MOUNT) The local directory path on each VM cluster node where the NFS server location is mounted. The local directory path and the NFS server location must each be the same across all of the VM cluster nodes. Ensure that the NFS mount is maintained continuously on all of the VM cluster nodes. 
	* `mount_type` - (Required) Mount type for backup destination.
	* `nfs_server` - (Required when mount_type=AUTOMATED_MOUNT) IP addresses for NFS Auto mount.
	* `nfs_server_export` - (Required when mount_type=AUTOMATED_MOUNT) Specifies the directory on which to mount the file system
* `type` - (Required) Type of the backup destination.
* `vpc_users` - (Required when type=RECOVERY_APPLIANCE) (Updatable) The Virtual Private Catalog (VPC) users that are used to access the Recovery Appliance.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
