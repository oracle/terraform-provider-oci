## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `apply_action_schedule` - (Optional) Scheduling related details for the Exadata Fleet Update Action during create operations. The specified time should not conflict with existing Exadata Infrastructure maintenance windows. Null scheduleDetails for Stage and Apply Actions in Exadata Fleet Update Cycle creation would not create Actions. Null scheduleDetails for CreateAction would execute the Exadata Fleet Update Action as soon as possible. 
	* `time_to_start` - (Required) The date and time the Exadata Fleet Update Action is expected to start. [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339), section 14.29. 
	* `type` - (Required) Type of scheduling strategy to use for Fleet Patching Update Action execution. 
* `batching_strategy` - (Optional) (Updatable) Batching strategy details to use during PRECHECK and APPLY Cycle Actions. 
	* `is_force_rolling` - (Applicable when type=FIFTY_FIFTY | SEQUENTIAL | SERVICE_AVAILABILITY_FACTOR) (Updatable) True to force rolling patching. 
	* `is_wait_for_batch_resume` - (Applicable when type=FIFTY_FIFTY) (Updatable) True to wait for customer to resume the Apply Action once the first half is done. False to automatically patch the second half. 
	* `percentage` - (Applicable when type=SERVICE_AVAILABILITY_FACTOR) (Updatable) Percentage of availability in the service during the Patch operation. 
	* `type` - (Optional) (Updatable) Supported batching strategies. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) Compartment Identifier.

* `diagnostics_collection` - (Optional) (Updatable) Details to configure diagnostics collection for targets affected by this Exadata Fleet Update Maintenance Cycle. 
	* `log_collection_mode` - (Optional) (Updatable) Enable incident logs and trace collection.  Allow Oracle to collect incident logs and traces to enable fault diagnosis and issue resolution according to the selected mode. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) Exadata Fleet Update Cycle display name. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}`

CREATE_NEW: Create a new DBHome (for Database Collections) for the specified image or version. USE_EXISTING: All database targets in the same VMCluster or CloudVmCluster will be moved to a shared database home.  If an existing home for the selected image or version is not found in the VM Cluster for a target database, then a new home will be created.  If more than one existing home for the selected image is found, then the home with the least number of databases will be used.  If multiple homes have the least number of databases, then a home will be selected at random. 
	* `new_home_prefix` - (Optional) (Updatable) Prefix name used for new DB home resources created as part of the Stage Action. Format: <specified_prefix>_<timestamp> If not specified, a default Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DB home resource will be generated for the new DB home resources created.

	* `type` - (Required) (Updatable) Type of goal target version specified 
	* `version` - (Required when type=VERSION) (Updatable) Target DB or GI version string for the Exadata Fleet Update Cycle.

* `stage_action_schedule` - (Optional) Scheduling related details for the Exadata Fleet Update Action during create operations. The specified time should not conflict with existing Exadata Infrastructure maintenance windows. Null scheduleDetails for Stage and Apply Actions in Exadata Fleet Update Cycle creation would not create Actions. Null scheduleDetails for CreateAction would execute the Exadata Fleet Update Action as soon as possible. 
	* `time_to_start` - (Required) The date and time the Exadata Fleet Update Action is expected to start. [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339), section 14.29. 
	* `type` - (Required) Type of scheduling strategy to use for Fleet Patching Update Action execution. 
* `type` - (Required) (Updatable) Type of Exadata Fleet Update Cycle. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
