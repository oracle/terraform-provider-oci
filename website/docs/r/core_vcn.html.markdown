  Provides the Vcn resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service

# oci_core_vcn
This resource provides the Vcn resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

The VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security list, and default set of DHCP options.
For managing these resources, see [Managing Default VCN Resources](/docs/providers/oci/guides/managing_default_resources.html)

Creates a new Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). For more information, see
[VCNs and Subnets](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVCNs.htm).

For the VCN, you specify a list of one or more IPv4 CIDR blocks that meet the following criteria:

- The CIDR blocks must be valid.
- They must not overlap with each other or with the on-premises network CIDR block.
- The number of CIDR blocks does not exceed the limit of CIDR blocks allowed per VCN.

For a CIDR block, Oracle recommends that you use one of the private IP address ranges specified in [RFC 1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16/12, and 192.168/16). Example:
172.16.0.0/16. The CIDR blocks can range from /16 to /30.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment where you want the VCN to
reside. Consult an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure administrator in your organization if you're not sure which
compartment to use. Notice that the VCN doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the subnets or other
Networking Service components. For more information about compartments and access control, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm). For information about OCIDs, see
[Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the VCN, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to
be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

You can also add a DNS label for the VCN, which is required if you want the instances to use the
Interent and VCN Resolver option for DNS in the VCN. For more information, see
[DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm).

The VCN automatically comes with a default route table, default security list, and default set of DHCP options.
The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for each is returned in the response. You can't delete these default objects, but you can change their
contents (that is, change the route rules, security list rules, and so on).

The VCN and subnets you create are not accessible until you attach an internet gateway or set up a Site-to-Site VPN
or FastConnect. For more information, see
[Overview of the Networking Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm).

}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `byoipv6cidr_details` - (Optional) The list of BYOIPv6 OCIDs and BYOIPv6 prefixes required to create a VCN that uses BYOIPv6 address ranges. 
	* `byoipv6range_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the `ByoipRange` resource to which the CIDR block belongs.
	* `ipv6cidr_block` - (Required) An IPv6 prefix required to create a VCN with a BYOIP prefix. It could be the whole prefix identified in `byoipv6RangeId`, or a subrange. Example: `2001:0db8:0123::/48` 
* `cidr_block` - (Optional) **Deprecated.** Do *not* set this value. Use `cidr_blocks` instead. Example: `10.0.0.0/16` 
* `cidr_blocks` - (Optional) (Updatable) The list of one or more IPv4 CIDR blocks for the VCN that meet the following criteria:
	* The CIDR blocks must be valid.
	* They must not overlap with each other or with the on-premises network CIDR block.
	* The number of CIDR blocks must not exceed the limit of CIDR blocks allowed per VCN. It is an error to set both cidr_block and cidr_blocks. Note: cidr_blocks update must be restricted to one operation at a time (either add/remove or modify one single cidr_block) or the operation will be declined. new cidr_block to be added must be placed at the end of the list. Once you migrate to using `cidr_blocks` from `cidr_block`, you will not be able to switch back.
	**Important:** Do *not* specify a value for `cidr_block`. Use this parameter instead. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment to contain the VCN.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}`
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `dns_label` - (Optional) A DNS label for the VCN, used in conjunction with the VNIC's hostname and subnet's DNS label to form a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for each VNIC within this subnet (for example, `bminstance1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com`). Not required to be unique, but it's a best practice to set unique DNS labels for VCNs in your tenancy. Must be an alphanumeric string that begins with a letter. The value cannot be changed.
	You must set this value if you want instances to be able to use hostnames to resolve other instances in the VCN. Otherwise the Internet and VCN Resolver will not work.

	For more information, see [DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm).

	Example: `vcn1`
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}`
* `ipv6private_cidr_blocks` - (Optional) The list of one or more ULA or Private IPv6 CIDR blocks for the vcn that meets the following criteria:
	* The CIDR blocks must be valid.
	* Multiple CIDR blocks must not overlap each other or the on-premises network prefix.
	* The number of CIDR blocks must not exceed the limit of IPv6 prefixes allowed to a VCN.

	**Important:** Do *not* specify a value for `ipv6cidr_block`. Use this parameter instead. 
* `is_ipv6enabled` - (Optional) Whether IPv6 is enabled for the VCN. Default is `false`. If enabled, Oracle will assign the VCN a IPv6 /56 CIDR block. You may skip having Oracle allocate the VCN a IPv6 /56 CIDR block by setting isOracleGuaAllocationEnabled to `false`. For important details about IPv6 addressing in a VCN, see [IPv6 Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/ipv6.htm).  Example: `true` 
* `is_oracle_gua_allocation_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether to skip Oracle allocated IPv6 GUA. By default, Oracle will allocate one GUA of /56 size for an IPv6 enabled VCN.
* `security_attributes` - (Optional) (Updatable) Security Attributes for this resource. This is unique to ZPR, and helps identify which resources are allowed to be accessed by what permission controls.  Example: `{"Oracle-DataSecurity-ZPR.MaxEgressCount.value": "42", "Oracle-DataSecurity-ZPR.MaxEgressCount.mode": "audit"}`

** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
