  Provides the Virtual Circuit resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service

# oci_core_virtual_circuit
This resource provides the Virtual Circuit resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Creates a new virtual circuit to use with Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure FastConnect. For more information, see
[FastConnect Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the virtual circuit to reside. If you're
not sure which compartment to use, put the virtual circuit in the
same compartment with the DRG it's using. For more information about
compartments and access control, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).
For information about OCIDs, see
[Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the virtual circuit.
It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

**Important:** When creating a virtual circuit, you specify a DRG for
the traffic to flow through. Make sure you attach the DRG to your
VCN and confirm the VCN's routing sends traffic to the DRG. Otherwise
traffic will not flow. For more information, see
[Route Tables](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm).
