# oci_data_safe_library_masking_format
This resource provides the Library Masking Format resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Creates a new library masking format. A masking format can have one or more
format entries. The combined output of all the format entries is used for masking.
It provides the flexibility to define a masking format that can generate different
parts of a data value separately and then combine them to get the final data value
for masking. Note that you cannot define masking condition in a library masking format.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment where the library masking format should be created.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) The description of the library masking format.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The display name of the library masking format. The name does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
* `format_entries` - (Required) (Updatable) An array of format entries. The combined output of all the format entries is used for masking.
	* `column_name` - (Required when type=DETERMINISTIC_SUBSTITUTION | RANDOM_SUBSTITUTION) (Updatable) The name of the substitution column.
	* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) The description of the format entry.
	* `end_date` - (Required when type=DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPTION_DATE | RANDOM_DATE) (Updatable) The upper bound of the range within which all the original column values fall. The end date must be greater than or equal to the start date.  
	* `end_length` - (Required when type=RANDOM_DIGITS | RANDOM_STRING) (Updatable) The maximum number of characters the generated strings should have. It can  be any integer greater than zero, but it must be greater than or equal to  the start length.  
	* `end_value` - (Required when type=RANDOM_DECIMAL_NUMBER | RANDOM_NUMBER) (Updatable) The upper bound of the range within which random decimal numbers should be generated. It must be greater than or equal to the start value. It supports  input of double type.  
	* `fixed_number` - (Required when type=FIXED_NUMBER) (Updatable) The constant number to be used for masking.
	* `fixed_string` - (Required when type=FIXED_STRING) (Updatable) The constant string to be used for masking.
	* `grouping_columns` - (Applicable when type=SHUFFLE) (Updatable) One or more reference columns to be used to group column values so that they can be shuffled within their own group. The grouping columns and  the column to be masked must belong to the same table.  
	* `length` - (Required when type=SUBSTRING) (Updatable) The number of characters that should be there in the substring. It should be an integer and greater than zero.  
	* `library_masking_format_id` - (Required when type=LIBRARY_MASKING_FORMAT) (Updatable) The OCID of the library masking format.
	* `pattern` - (Required when type=PATTERN) (Updatable) The pattern that should be used to mask data.
	* `post_processing_function` - (Required when type=POST_PROCESSING_FUNCTION) (Updatable) The post processing function in SCHEMA_NAME.PACKAGE_NAME.FUNCTION_NAME format. It can be a standalone or packaged function, so PACKAGE_NAME is optional.  
	* `random_list` - (Required when type=RANDOM_LIST) (Updatable) A comma-separated list of values to be used to replace column values. The list can be of strings, numbers, or dates. The data type of each value in the list must be compatible with the data type of the column. The number of entries in the list cannot be more than 999.  
	* `regular_expression` - (Required when type=DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPTION | REGULAR_EXPRESSION) (Updatable) The regular expression to be used for masking. For data with characters in the ASCII character set, providing a regular expression is optional. However, it  is required if the data contains multi-byte characters. If not provided, an  error is returned when a multi-byte character is found.

		In the case of ASCII characters, if a regular expression is not provided,  Deterministic Encryption can encrypt variable-length column values while  preserving their original format.

		If a regular expression is provided, the column values in all the rows must match  the regular expression. Deterministic Encryption supports a subset of the regular  expression language. It supports encryption of fixed-length strings, and does not  support * or + syntax of regular expressions. The encrypted values also match the  regular expression, which helps to ensure that the original format is preserved.  If an original value does not match the regular expression, Deterministic Encryption  might not produce a one-to-one mapping. All non-confirming values are mapped to a  single encrypted value, thereby producing a many-to-one mapping.  
	* `replace_with` - (Required when type=REGULAR_EXPRESSION) (Updatable) The value that should be used to replace the data matching the regular  expression. It can be a fixed string, fixed number or null value. 
	* `schema_name` - (Required when type=DETERMINISTIC_SUBSTITUTION | RANDOM_SUBSTITUTION) (Updatable) The name of the schema that contains the substitution column.
	* `sql_expression` - (Required when type=SQL_EXPRESSION) (Updatable) The SQL expression to be used to generate the masked values. It can  consist of one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that  evaluate to a value. It can also contain substitution columns from  the same table. Specify the substitution columns within percent (%)  symbols.  
	* `start_date` - (Required when type=DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPTION_DATE | RANDOM_DATE) (Updatable) The lower bound of the range within which all the original column values fall. The start date must be less than or equal to the end date.  
	* `start_length` - (Required when type=RANDOM_DIGITS | RANDOM_STRING) (Updatable) The minimum number of characters the generated strings should have. It can  be any integer greater than zero, but it must be less than or equal to the  end length.  
	* `start_position` - (Required when type=SUBSTRING) (Updatable) The starting position in the original string from where the substring should be extracted. It can be either a positive or a negative integer. If It's negative, the counting starts from the end of the string.  
	* `start_value` - (Required when type=RANDOM_DECIMAL_NUMBER | RANDOM_NUMBER) (Updatable) The lower bound of the range within which random decimal numbers should  be generated. It must be less than or equal to the end value. It supports  input of double type. 
	* `table_name` - (Required when type=DETERMINISTIC_SUBSTITUTION | RANDOM_SUBSTITUTION) (Updatable) The name of the table that contains the substitution column.
	* `type` - (Required) (Updatable) The type of the format entry.
	* `user_defined_function` - (Required when type=USER_DEFINED_FUNCTION) (Updatable) The user-defined function in SCHEMA_NAME.PACKAGE_NAME.FUNCTION_NAME format.  It can be a standalone or packaged function, so PACKAGE_NAME is optional.  
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm)  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `sensitive_type_ids` - (Optional) (Updatable) An array of OCIDs of the sensitive types compatible with the library masking format. It helps track the sensitive types for which the library masking format is being created. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
