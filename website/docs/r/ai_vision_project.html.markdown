```hcl
resource "oci_ai_vision_project" "test_project" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = var.project_defined_tags
	description = var.project_description
	display_name = var.project_display_name
	freeform_tags = var.project_freeform_tags
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The compartment identifier.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For example: `{"foo-namespace": {"bar-key": "value"}}`

Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
