# oci_core_compute_capacity_reservation
This resource provides the Compute Capacity Reservation resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Creates a new compute capacity reservation in the specified compartment and availability domain.
Compute capacity reservations let you reserve instances in a compartment.
When you launch an instance using this reservation, you are assured that you have enough space for your instance, 
and you won't get out of capacity errors.
For more information, see [Reserved Capacity](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/reserve-capacity.htm).

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `availability_domain` - (Required) The availability domain of this compute capacity reservation.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the capacity reservation. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `instance_reservation_configs` - (Optional) (Updatable) The capacity configurations for the capacity reservation. (Note: From 6.17.0 instance_reservation_configs field in oci_core_compute_capacity_reservation is changed from TypeList to TypeSet - to avoid unnecessary updates. Also, configs cant by accessed by index)

	To use the reservation for the desired shape, specify the shape, count, and optionally the fault domain where you want this configuration. 
	* `cluster_config` - (Optional) (Updatable) The HPC cluster configuration requested when launching instances in a compute capacity reservation.

		If the parameter is provided, the reservation is created with the HPC island and a list of HPC blocks that you specify. If a list of HPC blocks are missing or not provided, the reservation is created with any HPC blocks in the HPC island that you specify. If the values of HPC island or HPC block that you provide are not valid, an error is returned.
		* `hpc_island_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the HPC island. 
		* `network_block_ids` - (Optional) (Updatable) The list of OCIDs of the network blocks.
	* `cluster_placement_group_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The OCID of the cluster placement group for this instance reservation capacity configuration.
	* `fault_domain` - (Optional) (Updatable) The fault domain to use for instances created using this capacity configuration. For more information, see [Fault Domains](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm#fault). If you do not specify the fault domain, the capacity is available for an instance that does not specify a fault domain. To change the fault domain for a reservation, delete the reservation and create a new one in the preferred fault domain.

		To retrieve a list of fault domains, use the `ListFaultDomains` operation in the [Identity and Access Management Service API](/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/).

		Example: `FAULT-DOMAIN-1` 
	* `instance_shape` - (Required) (Updatable) The shape requested when launching instances using reserved capacity. The shape determines the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and other resources allocated to the instance. You can list all available shapes by calling [ListComputeCapacityReservationInstanceShapes](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/computeCapacityReservationInstanceShapes/ListComputeCapacityReservationInstanceShapes). 
	* `instance_shape_config` - (Optional) (Updatable) The shape configuration requested when launching instances in a compute capacity reservation.

		If the parameter is provided, the reservation is created with the resources that you specify. If some properties are missing or the parameter is not provided, the reservation is created with the default configuration values for the `shape` that you specify.

		Each shape only supports certain configurable values. If the values that you provide are not valid for the specified `shape`, an error is returned.

		For more information about customizing the resources that are allocated to flexible shapes, see [Flexible Shapes](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm#flexible). 
		* `memory_in_gbs` - (Optional) (Updatable) The total amount of memory available to the instance, in gigabytes. 
		* `ocpus` - (Optional) (Updatable) The total number of OCPUs available to the instance. 
	* `reserved_count` - (Required) (Updatable) The total number of instances that can be launched from the capacity configuration.
* `is_default_reservation` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether this capacity reservation is the default. For more information, see [Capacity Reservations](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/reserve-capacity.htm#default). 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
