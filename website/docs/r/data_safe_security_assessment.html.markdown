# oci_data_safe_security_assessment
This resource provides the Security Assessment resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Creates a new saved security assessment for one or multiple targets in a compartment. When this operation is performed,
it will save the latest assessments in the specified compartment. If a schedule is passed, it will persist the latest assessments,
at the defined date and time, in the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_data_safe_security_assessment" "test_security_assessment" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.security_assessment_description
	display_name = var.security_assessment_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	is_assessment_scheduled = var.security_assessment_is_assessment_scheduled
	schedule = var.security_assessment_schedule
	target_id = oci_cloud_guard_target.test_target.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment that contains the security assessment.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) Description of the security assessment.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The display name of the security assessment.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm)  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_assessment_scheduled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates whether the assessment is scheduled to run.
* `schedule` - (Optional) (Updatable) To schedule the assessment for running periodically, specify the schedule in this attribute. Create or schedule one assessment per compartment. If not defined, the assessment runs immediately. Format - <version-string>;<version-specific-schedule>

	Allowed version strings - "v1" v1's version specific schedule -<ss> <mm> <hh> <day-of-week> <day-of-month> Each of the above fields potentially introduce constraints. A workrequest is created only when clock time satisfies all the constraints. Constraints introduced: 1. seconds = <ss> (So, the allowed range for <ss> is [0, 59]) 2. minutes = <mm> (So, the allowed range for <mm> is [0, 59]) 3. hours = <hh> (So, the allowed range for <hh> is [0, 23]) <day-of-week> can be either '*' (without quotes or a number between 1(Monday) and 7(Sunday)) 4. No constraint introduced when it is '*'. When not, day of week must equal the given value <day-of-month> can be either '*' (without quotes or a number between 1 and 28) 5. No constraint introduced when it is '*'. When not, day of month must equal the given value 
* `target_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the target database on which security assessment is to be run.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

	LATEST: The most up-to-date assessment that is running automatically for a target. It is system generated. SAVED: A saved security assessment. LATEST assessments are always saved in order to maintain the history of runs. A SAVED assessment is also generated by a 'refresh' action (triggered by the user). SAVE_SCHEDULE: The schedule for periodic saves of LATEST assessments. COMPARTMENT: An automatically managed assessment type that stores all details of targets in one compartment. This type keeps an up-to-date assessment of all database risks in one compartment. It is automatically updated when the latest assessment or refresh action is executed. It is also automatically updated when a target is deleted or move to a different compartment. 

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Security Assessment
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Security Assessment
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Security Assessment


## Import

SecurityAssessments can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_data_safe_security_assessment.test_security_assessment "id"
```
