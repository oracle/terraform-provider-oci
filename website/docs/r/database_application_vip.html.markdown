## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_database_application_vip" "test_application_vip" {
	#Required
	cloud_vm_cluster_id = oci_database_cloud_vm_cluster.test_cloud_vm_cluster.id
	hostname_label = var.application_vip_hostname_label
	subnet_id = oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id

	#Optional
	db_node_id = oci_database_db_node.test_db_node.id
	ip_address = var.application_vip_ip_address
	ipv6address = var.application_vip_ipv6address
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cloud_vm_cluster_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the cloud VM cluster associated with the application virtual IP (VIP) address.
* `db_node_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DB node associated with the application virtual IP (VIP) address.
* `hostname_label` - (Required) The hostname of the application virtual IP (VIP) address.
* `ip_address` - (Optional) The application virtual IP (VIP) IPv4 address.
* `ipv6address` - (Optional) The application virtual IP (VIP) IPv6 address.
