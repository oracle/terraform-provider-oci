# oci_core_cross_connect
This resource provides the Cross Connect resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Creates a new cross-connect. Oracle recommends you create each cross-connect in a
[CrossConnectGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/CrossConnectGroup) so you can use link aggregation
with the connection.

After creating the `CrossConnect` object, you need to go the FastConnect location
and request to have the physical cable installed. For more information, see
[FastConnect Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm).

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the
compartment where you want the cross-connect to reside. If you're
not sure which compartment to use, put the cross-connect in the
same compartment with your VCN. For more information about
compartments and access control, see
[Overview of the IAM Service](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm).
For information about OCIDs, see
[Resource Identifiers](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the cross-connect.
It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.


## Example Usage

* `customer_reference_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A reference name or identifier for the physical fiber connection that this cross-connect uses. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `far_cross_connect_or_cross_connect_group_id` - (Optional) If you already have an existing cross-connect or cross-connect group at this FastConnect location, and you want this new cross-connect to be on a different router (for the purposes of redundancy), provide the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of that existing cross-connect or cross-connect group.

* `is_active` - (Optional) (Updatable) Set to true to activate the cross-connect. You activate it after the physical cabling is complete, and you've confirmed the cross-connect's light levels are good and your side of the interface is up. Activation indicates to Oracle that the physical connection is ready.

    * `encryption_cipher` - (Optional) (Updatable) Type of encryption cipher suite to use for the MACsec connection.
    * `is_unprotected_traffic_allowed` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates whether unencrypted traffic is allowed if MACsec Key Agreement protocol (MKA) fails.
    * `primary_key` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defines the secret [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)s held in Vault that represent the MACsec key.
        * `connectivity_association_key_secret_id` - (Required) (Updatable) Secret [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) containing the Connectivity Association Key (CAK) of this MACsec key.
		* `connectivity_association_key_secret_version` - (Optional) (Updatable) The secret version of the `connectivity_association_key_secret_id` secret in Vault.

            NOTE: Only the latest secret version will be used.

            NOTE: Only the latest secret version will be used. 
    * `state` - (Required) (Updatable) Indicates whether or not MACsec is enabled.
* `near_cross_connect_or_cross_connect_group_id` - (Optional) If you already have an existing cross-connect or cross-connect group at this FastConnect location, and you want this new cross-connect to be on the same router, provide the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of that existing cross-connect or cross-connect group.
