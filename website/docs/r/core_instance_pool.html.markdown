# oci_core_instance_pool
This resource provides the Instance Pool resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Creates an instance pool.

To determine whether capacity is available for a specific shape before you create an instance pool,
use the [CreateComputeCapacityReport](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/ComputeCapacityReport/CreateComputeCapacityReport)
operation.

* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `instance_configuration_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the instance configuration associated with the instance pool. 
* `instance_display_name_formatter` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly formatter for the instance pool's instances. Instance displaynames follow the format. The formatter does not retroactively change instance's displaynames, only instance displaynames in the future follow the format 
* `instance_hostname_formatter` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly formatter for the instance pool's instances. Instance hostnames follow the format. The formatter does not retroactively change instance's hostnames, only instance hostnames in the future follow the format 
* `load_balancers` - (Optional) The load balancers to attach to the instance pool. (Note: From 6.16.0 load_balancers field in oci_core_instance_pool is changed from TypeList to TypeSet - to support load balancer insert operation. Also, LB cant by accessed by index)
	* `backend_set_name` - (Required) The name of the backend set on the load balancer to add instances to.
	* `load_balancer_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the load balancer to attach to the instance pool. 
	* `port` - (Required) The port value to use when creating the backend set.
	* `vnic_selection` - (Required) Indicates which VNIC on each instance in the pool should be used to associate with the load balancer. Possible values are "PrimaryVnic" or the displayName of one of the secondary VNICs on the instance configuration that is associated with the instance pool. 
* `placement_configurations` - (Required) (Updatable) The placement configurations for the instance pool. Provide one placement configuration for each availability domain.

	To use the instance pool with a regional subnet, provide a placement configuration for each availability domain, and include the regional subnet in each placement configuration. 
	* `availability_domain` - (Required) (Updatable) The availability domain to place instances.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
	* `fault_domains` - (Optional) (Updatable) The fault domains to place instances.

		If you don't provide any values, the system makes a best effort to distribute instances across all fault domains based on capacity.

		To distribute the instances evenly across selected fault domains, provide a set of fault domains. For example, you might want instances to be evenly distributed if your applications require high availability.

		To get a list of fault domains, use the [ListFaultDomains](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains) operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

		Example: `[FAULT-DOMAIN-1, FAULT-DOMAIN-2, FAULT-DOMAIN-3]`
	* `primary_subnet_id` - (Optional) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the primary subnet to place instances. This field is deprecated. Use `primaryVnicSubnets` instead to set VNIC data for instances in the pool. 
	* `primary_vnic_subnets` - (Optional) (Updatable) Details about the IPv6 primary subnet.
		* `ipv6address_ipv6subnet_cidr_pair_details` - (Optional) (Updatable) A list of IPv6 prefix ranges from which the VNIC should be assigned an IPv6 address. You can provide only the prefix ranges and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will select an available address from the range. You can optionally choose to leave the prefix range empty and instead provide the specific IPv6 address that should be used from within that range. 
			* `ipv6subnet_cidr` - (Optional) (Updatable) Optional. Used to disambiguate which subnet prefix should be used to create an IPv6 allocation. 
		* `is_assign_ipv6ip` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether to allocate an IPv6 address at instance and VNIC creation from an IPv6 enabled subnet. Default: False. When provided you may optionally provide an IPv6 prefix (`ipv6SubnetCidr`) of your choice to assign the IPv6 address from. If `ipv6SubnetCidr` is not provided then an IPv6 prefix is chosen for you. 
		* `subnet_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The subnet [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the secondary VNIC.
	* `secondary_vnic_subnets` - (Optional) (Updatable) The set of secondary VNIC data for instances in the pool.
		* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The display name of the VNIC. This is also used to match against the instance configuration defined secondary VNIC.
		* `ipv6address_ipv6subnet_cidr_pair_details` - (Optional) (Updatable) A list of IPv6 prefix ranges from which the VNIC should be assigned an IPv6 address. You can provide only the prefix ranges and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will select an available address from the range. You can optionally choose to leave the prefix range empty and instead provide the specific IPv6 address that should be used from within that range. 
			* `ipv6subnet_cidr` - (Optional) (Updatable) Optional. Used to disambiguate which subnet prefix should be used to create an IPv6 allocation. 
		* `is_assign_ipv6ip` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether to allocate an IPv6 address at instance and VNIC creation from an IPv6 enabled subnet. Default: False. When provided you may optionally provide an IPv6 prefix (`ipv6SubnetCidr`) of your choice to assign the IPv6 address from. If `ipv6SubnetCidr` is not provided then an IPv6 prefix is chosen for you. 
		* `subnet_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The subnet [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) for the secondary VNIC.
* `size` - (Required) (Updatable) The number of instances that should be in the instance pool. Modifying this value will override the size of the instance pool. If the instance pool is linked with autoscaling configuration, autoscaling configuration could resize the instance pool at a later point. The instance pool's actual size may differ from the configured size if it is associated with an autoscaling configuration, instance pool's actual size will be reflected in this size attribute. 
* `state` - (Optional) (Updatable) The target state for the instance pool update operation (ignored at create time and should not be set). Could be set to RUNNING or STOPPED.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
