* `service_level_agreement_type` - The service level agreement type of the container database. The default is STANDARD.
* `standby_maintenance_buffer_in_days` - The scheduling detail for the quarterly maintenance window of the standby Autonomous Container Database. This value represents the number of days before scheduled maintenance of the primary database. 
* `state` - The current state of the Autonomous Container Database.
* `system_tags` - System tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `time_created` - The date and time the Autonomous Container Database was created.
* `time_of_last_backup` - The timestamp of last successful backup. Here NULL value represents either there are no successful backups or backups are not configured for this Autonomous Container Database.
* `time_snapshot_standby_revert` - The date and time the Autonomous Container Database will be reverted to Standby from Snapshot Standby.
* `total_cpus` - The number of CPUs allocated to the Autonomous VM cluster. 
* `vault_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm#concepts). This parameter and `secretId` are required for Customer Managed Keys.
* `version_preference` - The next maintenance version preference. 
* `vm_failover_reservation` - The percentage of CPUs reserved across nodes to support node failover. Allowed values are 0%, 25%, and 50%, with 50% being the default option.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Autonomous Container Database Add Standby
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Autonomous Container Database Add Standby
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Autonomous Container Database Add Standby


## Import

AutonomousContainerDatabaseAddStandby can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_database_autonomous_container_database_add_standby.test_autonomous_container_database_add_standby "id"
```
