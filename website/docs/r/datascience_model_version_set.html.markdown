# oci_datascience_model_version_set
This resource provides the Model Version Set resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science service.

Creates a new modelVersionSet.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_datascience_model_version_set" "test_model_version_set" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	name = var.model_version_set_name
	project_id = oci_datascience_project.test_project.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.model_version_set_description
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment to create the model version set in.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) A short description of the model version set.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `name` - (Required) A user-friendly name for the resource. It must be unique and can't be modified. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: `My model version set` 
* `project_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the project to associate with the model version set.


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `category` - The category of the model version set.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the model version set compartment.
* `created_by` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the user who created the model version set.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - A short description of the model version set.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the model version set.
* `name` - A user-friendly name for the resource. It must be unique and can't be modified.
* `project_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the project associated with the model version set.
* `state` - The state of the model version set.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - The date and time that the resource was created in the timestamp format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). Example: 2019-08-25T21:10:29.41Z 
* `time_updated` - The date and time that the resource was created in the timestamp format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). Example: 2019-08-25T21:10:29.41Z 

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Model Version Set
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Model Version Set
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Model Version Set


## Import

ModelVersionSets can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_datascience_model_version_set.test_model_version_set "id"
```
