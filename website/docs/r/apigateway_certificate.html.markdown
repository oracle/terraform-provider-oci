This resource provides the Certificate resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API Gateway service.

Creates a new Certificate.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_apigateway_certificate" "test_certificate" {
	#Required
	certificate = "${var.certificate_certificate}"
	compartment_id = "${var.compartment_id}"
	private_key = "${var.certificate_private_key}"

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	display_name = "${var.certificate_display_name}"
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	intermediate_certificates = var.certificate_intermediate_certificates
	locks {
		#Required
		type = var.certificate_locks_type

		#Optional
		message = var.certificate_locks_message
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `certificate` - (Required) The data of the leaf certificate in pem format.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment in which the resource is created. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `My new resource` 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `intermediate_certificates` - (Optional) The intermediate certificate data associated with the certificate in pem format.
* `locks` - (Optional) Locks associated with this resource.
	* `message` - (Optional) A message added by the creator of the lock. This is typically used to give an indication of why the resource is locked. 
	* `type` - (Required) Type of the lock.
* `private_key` - (Required) The private key associated with the certificate in pem format.
