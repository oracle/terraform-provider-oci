## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `create_vnic_details` - (Required) (Updatable) Contains properties for a VNIC. You use this object when creating the primary VNIC during instance launch or when creating a secondary VNIC. For more information about VNICs, see [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm). 
	* `assign_ipv6ip` - (Optional) Whether to allocate an IPv6 address at instance and VNIC creation from an IPv6 enabled subnet. Default: False. When provided you may optionally provide an IPv6 prefix (`ipv6SubnetCidr`) of your choice to assign the IPv6 address from. If `ipv6SubnetCidr` is not provided then an IPv6 prefix is chosen for you. 
	* `assign_private_dns_record` - (Optional) Whether the VNIC should be assigned a DNS record. If set to false, there will be no DNS record registration for the VNIC. If set to true, the DNS record will be registered. The default value is true.
	* `assign_private_dns_record` - (Optional) Whether the VNIC should be assigned a DNS record. If set to false, no DNS record registion for the VNIC; if set to true, DNS record will be registered. Example: `true`

		If you specify a `hostnameLabel`, the `assignPrivateDnsRecord` is require to be set to true. 
	* `assign_public_ip` - (Optional) Whether the VNIC should be assigned a public IP address. Defaults to whether the subnet is public or private. If not set and the VNIC is being created in a private subnet (that is, where `prohibitPublicIpOnVnic` = true in the [Subnet](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Subnet/)), then no public IP address is assigned. If not set and the subnet is public (`prohibitPublicIpOnVnic` = false), then a public IP address is assigned. If set to true and `prohibitPublicIpOnVnic` = true, an error is returned.

		**Note:** This public IP address is associated with the primary private IP on the VNIC. For more information, see [IP Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm).

		**Note:** There's a limit to the number of [public IPs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PublicIp/) a VNIC or instance can have. If you try to create a secondary VNIC with an assigned public IP for an instance that has already reached its public IP limit, an error is returned. For information about the public IP limits, see [Public IP Addresses](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm).

		Example: `false`

		If you specify a `vlanId`, then `assignPublicIp` must be set to false. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan). 
	* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
	* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
	* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
	* `hostname_label` - (Optional) (Updatable) The hostname for the VNIC's primary private IP. Used for DNS. The value is the hostname portion of the primary private IP's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (for example, `bminstance1` in FQDN `bminstance1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com`). Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet and comply with [RFC 952](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952) and [RFC 1123](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123). The value appears in the `[Vnic](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vnic/)` object and also the `[PrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/)` object returned by `[ListPrivateIps](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/ListPrivateIps)` and `[GetPrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/GetPrivateIp)`.

		For more information, see [DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/dns.htm).

		When launching an instance, use this `hostnameLabel` instead of the deprecated `hostnameLabel` in `[LaunchInstanceDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/LaunchInstanceDetails)`. If you provide both, the values must match.

		Example: `bminstance1`

		If you specify a `vlanId`, the `hostnameLabel` cannot be specified. VNICs on a VLAN can not be assigned a hostname. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan). 
	* `ipv6address_ipv6subnet_cidr_pair_details` - (Optional) A list of IPv6 prefix ranges from which the VNIC should be assigned an IPv6 address. You can provide only the prefix ranges from which Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will select an available address from the range. You can optionally choose to leave the prefix range empty and instead provide the specific IPv6 address that should be used from within that range. 
	* `nsg_ids` - (Optional) (Updatable) A list of the OCIDs of the network security groups (NSGs) to add the VNIC to. For more information about NSGs, see [NetworkSecurityGroup](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/NetworkSecurityGroup/).

		If a `vlanId` is specified, the `nsgIds` cannot be specified. The `vlanId` indicates that the VNIC will belong to a VLAN instead of a subnet. With VLANs, all VNICs in the VLAN belong to the NSGs that are associated with the VLAN. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan). 
	* `private_ip` - (Optional) A private IP address of your choice to assign to the VNIC. Must be an available IP address within the subnet's CIDR. If you don't specify a value, Oracle automatically assigns a private IP address from the subnet. This is the VNIC's *primary* private IP address. The value appears in the `[Vnic](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vnic/)` object and also the `[PrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/)` object returned by `[ListPrivateIps](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/ListPrivateIps)` and `[GetPrivateIp](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/GetPrivateIp)`.

		 If you specify a `vlanId`, the `privateIp` cannot be specified. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan).
	
		Example: `10.0.3.3`
	* `security_attributes` - (Optional) Security Attributes for this resource. This is unique to ZPR, and helps identify which resources are allowed to be accessed by what permission controls.  Example: `{"Oracle-DataSecurity-ZPR.MaxEgressCount.value": "42", "Oracle-DataSecurity-ZPR.MaxEgressCount.mode": "audit"}` 
	* `skip_source_dest_check` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether the source/destination check is disabled on the VNIC. Defaults to `false`, which means the check is performed. For information about why you would skip the source/destination check, see [Using a Private IP as a Route Target](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingroutetables.htm#privateip).

		 If you specify a `vlanId`, the `skipSourceDestCheck` cannot be specified because the source/destination check is always disabled for VNICs in a VLAN. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan).

		Example: `true` 
	* `subnet_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the subnet to create the VNIC in. When launching an instance, use this `subnetId` instead of the deprecated `subnetId` in [LaunchInstanceDetails](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/requests/LaunchInstanceDetails). At least one of them is required; if you provide both, the values must match.

		If you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer and creating a secondary VNIC in a VLAN instead of a subnet, provide a `vlanId` instead of a `subnetId`. If you provide both a `vlanId` and `subnetId`, the request fails. 
	* `vlan_id` - (Optional) Provide this attribute only if you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer and creating a secondary VNIC in a VLAN. The value is the [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VLAN. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan).

		Provide a `vlanId` instead of a `subnetId`. If you provide both a `vlanId` and `subnetId`, the request fails. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `instance_id` - (Required) The OCID of the instance.
* `nic_index` - (Optional) Which physical network interface card (NIC) the VNIC will use. Defaults to 0. Certain bare metal instance shapes have two active physical NICs (0 and 1). If you add a secondary VNIC to one of these instances, you can specify which NIC the VNIC will use. For more information, see [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm). 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `availability_domain` - The availability domain of the instance.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment the VNIC attachment is in, which is the same compartment the instance is in. 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `id` - The OCID of the VNIC attachment.
* `instance_id` - The OCID of the instance.
* `nic_index` - Which physical network interface card (NIC) the VNIC uses. Certain bare metal instance shapes have two active physical NICs (0 and 1). If you add a secondary VNIC to one of these instances, you can specify which NIC the VNIC will use. For more information, see [Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm). 
* `state` - The current state of the VNIC attachment.
* `subnet_id` - The OCID of the subnet to create the VNIC in.
* `time_created` - The date and time the VNIC attachment was created, in the format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).  Example: `2016-08-25T21:10:29.600Z` 
* `vlan_id` - The OCID of the VLAN to create the VNIC in. Creating the VNIC in a VLAN (instead of a subnet) is possible only if you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan).

	An error is returned if the instance already has a VNIC attached to it from this VLAN. 
* `vlan_tag` - The Oracle-assigned VLAN tag of the attached VNIC. Available after the attachment process is complete.

	However, if the VNIC belongs to a VLAN as part of the Oracle Cloud VMware Solution, the `vlanTag` value is instead the value of the `vlanTag` attribute for the VLAN. See [Vlan](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan).

	Example: `0` 
* `vnic_id` - The OCID of the VNIC. Available after the attachment process is complete.
