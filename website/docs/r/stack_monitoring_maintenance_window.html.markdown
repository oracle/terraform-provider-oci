# oci_stack_monitoring_maintenance_window
This resource provides the Maintenance Window resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Stack Monitoring service.

Creates a new Maintenance Window for the given resources. It will create also the 
Alarms Suppression for each alarm that the resource migth trigger.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_stack_monitoring_maintenance_window" "test_maintenance_window" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	name = var.maintenance_window_name
	resources {
		#Required
		resource_id = oci_cloud_guard_resource.test_resource.id

		#Optional
		are_members_included = var.maintenance_window_resources_are_members_included
	}
	schedule {
		#Required
		schedule_type = var.maintenance_window_schedule_schedule_type

		#Optional
		maintenance_window_duration = var.maintenance_window_schedule_maintenance_window_duration
		maintenance_window_recurrences = var.maintenance_window_schedule_maintenance_window_recurrences
		time_maintenance_window_end = var.maintenance_window_schedule_time_maintenance_window_end
		time_maintenance_window_start = var.maintenance_window_schedule_time_maintenance_window_start
	}

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	description = var.maintenance_window_description
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
}
```
