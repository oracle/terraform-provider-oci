# oci_data_safe_audit_trail_management
This resource provides the Audit Trail Management resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Updates one or more attributes of the specified audit trail.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_data_safe_audit_trail_management" "test_audit_trail_management" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	target_id = oci_data_safe_target_database.test_target_database.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.audit_trail_management_description
	display_name = var.audit_trail_management_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	is_auto_purge_enabled = var.audit_trail_management_is_auto_purge_enabled
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `audit_trail_id` - (Required) The OCID of the audit trail.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `target_id` - (Required) The OCID of the target.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment that contains the target.
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) The description of the audit trail.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The display name of the audit trail. The name does not have to be unique, and it's updatable.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm)  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `is_auto_purge_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Indicates if auto purge is enabled on the target database, which helps delete audit data in the target database every seven days so that the database's audit trail does not become too large. 
* `state` - (Optional) (Updatable) The target state for the Audit Trail Management. Could be set to `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`. 
* `start_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when set to true triggers Start.
* `stop_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when set to true triggers Stop.
* `resume_trigger` - (Optional) (Updatable) An optional property when set to true triggers Resume.
* `audit_collection_start_time` - (Optional) The date from which the audit trail must start collecting data, in the format defined by RFC3339. It is a required field when start_trigger is set.
