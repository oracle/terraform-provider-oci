# oci_data_safe_unified_audit_policy
This resource provides the Unified Audit Policy resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Safe service.

Creates the specified unified audit policy.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_data_safe_unified_audit_policy" "test_unified_audit_policy" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	conditions {
		#Required
		entity_selection = var.unified_audit_policy_conditions_entity_selection
		entity_type = var.unified_audit_policy_conditions_entity_type
		operation_status = var.unified_audit_policy_conditions_operation_status

		#Optional
		attribute_set_id = oci_data_safe_attribute_set.test_attribute_set.id
		role_names = var.unified_audit_policy_conditions_role_names
		user_names = var.unified_audit_policy_conditions_user_names
	}
	security_policy_id = oci_data_safe_security_policy.test_security_policy.id
	status = var.unified_audit_policy_status
	unified_audit_policy_definition_id = oci_data_safe_unified_audit_policy_definition.test_unified_audit_policy_definition.id

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.unified_audit_policy_description
	display_name = var.unified_audit_policy_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `conditions` - (Required) (Updatable) Lists the audit policy provisioning conditions.
	* `attribute_set_id` - (Required when entity_type=ATTRIBUTE_SET) (Updatable) The OCID of the attribute set.
	* `entity_selection` - (Required) (Updatable) Specifies whether to include or exclude the specified users or roles.
	* `entity_type` - (Required) (Updatable) The type of users or roles that the unified audit policy is applied to.
	* `operation_status` - (Required) (Updatable) The operation status that the policy must be enabled for.
	* `role_names` - (Required when entity_type=ROLE) (Updatable) List of roles that the policy must be enabled for.
	* `user_names` - (Required when entity_type=USER) (Updatable) The list of users that the unified audit policy is enabled for.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm) Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) The description of the unified audit policy in Data Safe.
