# oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_recipe
This resource provides the Host Scan Recipe resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service.

Creates a new HostScanRecipe. A recipe determines the types of security issues that you want scanned, and how often to scan.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_recipe" "test_host_scan_recipe" {
	#Required
	agent_settings {
		#Required
		scan_level = var.host_scan_recipe_agent_settings_scan_level

		#Optional
		agent_configuration {
			#Required
			vendor = var.host_scan_recipe_agent_settings_agent_configuration_vendor

			#Optional
			cis_benchmark_settings {

				#Optional
				scan_level = var.host_scan_recipe_agent_settings_agent_configuration_cis_benchmark_settings_scan_level
			}
			endpoint_protection_settings {

				#Optional
				scan_level = var.host_scan_recipe_agent_settings_agent_configuration_endpoint_protection_settings_scan_level
			}
		}
	}
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	port_settings {
		#Required
		scan_level = var.host_scan_recipe_port_settings_scan_level
	}
	schedule {
		#Required
		type = var.host_scan_recipe_schedule_type

		#Optional
		day_of_week = var.host_scan_recipe_schedule_day_of_week
	}

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"foo-namespace.bar-key"= "value"}
	display_name = var.host_scan_recipe_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"bar-key"= "value"}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `agent_settings` - (Required) (Updatable) Agent scan settings for a host scan
	* `agent_configuration` - (Optional) (Updatable) Agent configuration for host scan agent settings. This model is polymorphic, presenting different configuration options based on selected agent vendor.
		* `cis_benchmark_settings` - (Optional) (Updatable) CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmark scan settings for a host scan
			* `scan_level` - (Optional) (Updatable) The level of strictness to apply for CIS Benchmarks. Use 'NONE' to disable CIS Benchmark checks entirely.
		* `endpoint_protection_settings` - (Optional) (Updatable) Endpoint Protection scan settings for a host scan
			* `scan_level` - (Optional) (Updatable) The scan level. Use 'NONE' to disable Endpoint Protection checks entirely.
		* `vendor` - (Required) (Updatable) Vendor to use for the host scan agent.
	* `scan_level` - (Required) (Updatable) The scan level
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) Compartment ID of the scanning config. If no individual hosts are specified, all hosts in this compartment are scanned
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) Recipe identifier, which can be renamed. If not present, it will be auto-generated. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `port_settings` - (Required) (Updatable) Port scan settings for a host scan
	* `scan_level` - (Required) (Updatable) The scan level
* `schedule` - (Required) (Updatable) A scanning schedule
	* `day_of_week` - (Optional) (Updatable) Day of week the scheduled scan occurs (not applicable for DAILY type)
	* `type` - (Required) (Updatable) How often the scan occurs


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `agent_settings` - Agent scan settings for a host scan
	* `agent_configuration` - Agent configuration for host scan agent settings. This model is polymorphic, presenting different configuration options based on selected agent vendor.

		* `endpoint_protection_settings` - Endpoint Protection scan settings for a host scan
			* `scan_level` - The scan level. Use 'NONE' to disable Endpoint Protection checks entirely.
		* `vendor` - Vendor to use for the host scan agent.
	* `scan_level` - The scan level
* `compartment_id` - Compartment ID of the scan recipe
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - Recipe identifier, which can be renamed

* `id` - Unique identifier of the config that is immutable on creation
* `port_settings` - Port scan settings for a host scan
	* `scan_level` - The scan level
* `schedule` - A scanning schedule
	* `day_of_week` - Day of week the scheduled scan occurs (not applicable for DAILY type)
	* `type` - How often the scan occurs
* `state` - The current state of the config.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - Date and time the recipe was created, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Host Scan Recipe
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Host Scan Recipe
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Host Scan Recipe


## Import

HostScanRecipes can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_recipe.test_host_scan_recipe "id"
```
