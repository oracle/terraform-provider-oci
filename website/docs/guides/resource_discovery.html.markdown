  The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider. Discovering resources in an existing compartment
---

## Resource Discovery

### Overview

Terraform Resource Discovery can be used to discover deployed resources within a compartment and export them to Terraform configuration and state files. Refer to the [Supported Resources](#supported-resources) for details.

### Use Cases and Benefits

With this feature, you can perform the following tasks:

* **Move from manually-managed infrastructure to Terraform-managed infrastructure:** You can generate a baseline Terraform state file for your existing infrastructure with a single command, and manage this infrastructure by using Terraform.

* **Detect state drift:** By managing the infrastructure using Terraform, you can detect when the state of your resources changes and differs from the desired configuration.

* **Duplicate or rebuild existing infrastructure:** By creating Terraform configuration files, you can re-create your existing infrastructure architecture in a new tenancy or compartment.

* **Get started with Terraform:** If you’re new to Terraform, you can learn about Terraform’s HCL syntax and how to represent Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources in HCL.

Please note that this feature is available for version 3.50 and above. The latest version of the terraform-oci-provider can be downloaded using terraform init or by going to https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-provider-oci/

> **Note**: Resource discovery is not a migration tool. For cloning or migrating resources, configurations generated by Resource Discovery are a starting point and may require some changes.


### Prerequisites

Download the latest terraform-oci-provider from [provider releases](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform-provider-oci/). After downloading, in order to run the executable:

    * either add the terraform-provider-oci executable to PATH
    * or run the executable giving the full path or from the directory where it is located

Resource discovery uses Hashicorp's [terraform-exec](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/) to import the discovered resources into the state file. Terraform exec requires terraform CLI to be present on your system. Download the [appropriate package](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) for your system.

Note: Terraform version v0.11.* is not supported by the tool for generating the state file. Only configurations are supported in v0.11. By default the configurations are generated in v0.12.
If specifying v0.13.* for the Terraform CLI, make sure that the version is compatible with v0.12 syntax.

The terraform CLI can be provided in 2 ways:

    * provide full path including name for the terraform CLI using environment variable `terraform_bin_path`
      OR
    * add terraform CLI to the system path and the tool will find it


### Authentication

To discover resources in your compartment, the terraform-oci-provider will need authentication information about the user, tenancy, and region with which to discover
the resources. It is recommended to specify a user that has access to inspect and read the resources to discover.

Resource discovery supports API Key based authentication and Instance Principal based authentication.

The authentication information can be specified using the following environment variables:

```
export TF_VAR_tenancy_ocid=<value>
export TF_VAR_user_ocid=<value>
export TF_VAR_fingerprint=<value>
export TF_VAR_private_key_path=<path to your private key>
export TF_VAR_region=<region of the resources, e.g. "us-phoenix-1">
```


If your private key is password-encrypted, you may also need to specify a password with this variable:

```
export TF_VAR_private_key_password=<password for private key>
```

The authentication information can also be specified using a configuration file. For details on setting this up, see [SDK and CLI configuration file](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)
A non-default profile can be set using environment variable:

```
export TF_VAR_config_file_profile=<value>
```


If the parameters have multiple sources, the priority will be in the following order:

    Environment variables
    Non-default profile
    DEFAULT profile

### Usage

Once you have specified the prerequisite authentication settings, the command can be used as follows with a compartment being specified by name or OCID:

```
terraform-provider-oci -command=export -compartment_name=<name of compartment to export> -output_path=<absolute path to directory under which to generate Terraform files>
```


```
terraform-provider-oci -command=export -compartment_id=<OCID of compartment to export> -output_path=<absolute path to directory under which to generate Terraform files>
```

This command will discover resources within your compartment and generates Terraform configuration files in the given `output_path`.
The generated `.tf` files contain the Terraform configuration with the resources that the command has discovered.

> **Note:**
Make sure the `output_path` is empty before running resource discovery

| Arguments | Resources discovered |
| ----------| -------------------- |
| compartment_id = \<empty or tenancy ocid\>  <br> services= \<empty\> or not specified | all tenancy and compartment scope resources <br>  |
| compartment_id = \<empty or tenancy ocid\>  <br> services= \<comma separated list of services\> | tenancy and compartment scope resources for the services specified |
| compartment_id = \<non-root compartment\> <br> services= \<empty\> or not specified | all compartment scope resources only |
| compartment_id = \<non-root compartment\> <br> services=\<comma separated list of services\> | compartment scope resources for the services specified<br>tenancy scope resources will not be discovered even if services with such resources are specified |

> **Notes**:
* The compartment export functionality currently supports discovery of the target compartment. The ability to discover resources in child compartments is not yet supported.
* If using Instance Principals, resources can not be discovered if compartment_id is not specified

### Exit status

While discovering resources if there is any error related to the APIs or service unavailability, the tool will move on to find next resource. All the errors encountered will be displayed after the discovery is complete.

* Exit code 0 - Success
* Exit code 1 - Failure due to errors such as incorrect environment variables, arguments or configuration
* Exit code 64 - Partial Success when resource discovery was not able to find all the resources because of the service failures

### Generated Terraform Configuration Contents

The command will discover resources that are in an active or usable state. Resources that have been terminated or otherwise made inactive are generally excluded from the generated configuration.

By default, the Terraform names of the discovered resources will share the same name as the display name for that resource, if one exists.

The attributes of the resources will be populated with the values that are returned by the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.

In some cases, a required or optional attribute may not be discoverable from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and may be omitted from the generated Terraform configuration.
This may be expected behavior from the service, which may prevent discovery of certain sensitive attributes or secrets. In such cases, placeholder value will be set along with a comment like this:

```
admin_password = "<placeholder for missing required attribute>" #Required attribute not found in discovery, placeholder value set to avoid plan failure
```

The missing required attributes will also be added to lifecycle ignore_changes. This is done to avoid terraform plan failure when moving manually-managed infrastructure to Terraform-managed infrastructure.
Any changes made to such fields will not reflect in terraform plan. If you want to update these fields, remove them from `ignore_changes`.

Resources that are dependent on availability domains will be generated under `availability_domain.tf` file. These include:
* oci\_core\_boot\_volume
* oci\_file\_storage\_file\_system
* oci\_file\_storage\_mount\_target
* oci\_file\_storage\_snapshot

### Exporting Identity Resources

Some resources, such as identity resources, may exist only at the tenancy level and cannot be discovered within a specific compartment. To discover such resources, specify
the following command.

```
terraform-provider-oci -command=export -output_path=<absolute path to directory under which to generate Terraform files> -services=identity
```

> **Note**: When exporting identity resources, a `compartment_id` is not required. If a `compartment_id` is specified, the value will be ignored for discovering identity resources.


### Exporting Resources to Another Compartment
Once the user has reviewed the generated configuration and made the necessary changes to reflect the desired settings, the configuration can be used with Terraform.
One such use case is the re-deploying of those resources in a new compartment or tenancy, using Terraform.

To do so, specify the following environment variables:

```
export TF_VAR_tenancy_ocid=<new tenancy OCID>
export TF_VAR_compartment_ocid=<new compartment OCID>
```

And run

```
terraform apply
```

### Generating a Terraform State File

Using this command it is also possible to generate a Terraform state file to manage the discovered resources. To do so, run the following command:

```
terraform-provider-oci -command=export -compartment_id=<compartment to export> -output_path=<absolute path to directory under which to generate Terraform files> -generate_state
```

The results of this command are both the `.tf` files representing the Terraform configuration and a `terraform.tfstate` file representing the state.

> **Note** The Terraform state file generated by this command is currently compatible with Terraform v0.12.4 and above


### Supported Resources
As of this writing, the list of Terraform services and resources that can be discovered by the command is as follows.
The list of supported resources can also be retrieved by running this command:
