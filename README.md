## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) v0.12.31 or greater
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.21.13 (recommended)


## Building the Provider

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/terraform-provider-oci`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-oci
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/terraform-provider-oci
$ make build
```


## Installation

If you're building the provider, follow the instructions to [install it as a plugin.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/basics.html#installing-a-plugin) 
After placing it into your plugins directory,  run `terraform init` to initialize it and begin using Terraform with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider.


## Troubleshooting the Provider

See [verbose logging](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/oci/guides/troubleshooting.html#verbose-logging-for-oci-terraform-provider) for the details.

## Developing the Provider

To add features to the provider, install [Go](http://www.golang.org) and configure your your [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)

Compile the provider by running `make build`. The provider binary will output to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory, make sure this has been added to your `$PATH`.

```sh
$ make build
```

To test the provider run `make testacc`.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

> **Note:** The tests run against live OCI service APIs, you will need to configure environment variables with valid credientials as shown in the [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/oci/index.html).
